ABSTRACT
The world around us changes constantly. Knowing what has
changed is an important part of our lives. For businesses,
recognizing changes is also crucial. It allows businesses to adapt
themselves to the changing market needs. In this paper, we study
changes of association rules from one time period to another. One
approach is to compare the supports and/or confidences of each
rule in the two time periods and report the differences. This
technique, however, is too simplistic as it tends to report a huge
number of rule changes, and many of them are, in fact, simply the
snowball effect of a small subset of fundamental changes. Here,
we present a technique to highlight the small subset of
fundamental changes. A change is fundamental if it cannot be
explained by some other changes. The proposed technique has
been applied to a number of real-life datasets. Experiments results
show that the number of rules whose changes are unexplainable is
quite small (about 20% of the total number of changes
discovered), and many of these unexplainable changes reflect
some fundamental shifts in the application domain.


Keywords: Change mining, data mining.

1. INTRODUCTION
Detecting and adapting to changes are important activities for
businesses and organizations. Companies and organizations want
to know what are the changes in order to tailor their products and
services to suit the changing needs of their customers. In many
business environments, mining for changes can be more important
than producing accurate models or classifiers for prediction,
which has been the focus of existing data mining research. A
model, no matter how accurate, in itself is passive because it can
only predict based on patterns mined in the old data. It should not
lead to actions that may change the environment because
otherwise the model will cease to be accurate. Building models
for prediction is more suitable in domains where the environment
is relatively stable and there is little human intervention.
However,
in
most
business
situations,
constant
human
intervention is a fact of life. Companies simply cannot allow

nature to take its course. They constantly need to perform actions
in order to provide better products and services, to win more
customers, and to resolve outstanding problems faced by the
companies. For example, in a supermarket, there are always
discounts and promotions to raise sale volume, to clear old stocks
and to generate more sale traffic. Change mining is important in
such situations as it allows the supermarket to compare results
before and after promotions to see whether the promotions are
effective, and to find interesting changes in customer behaviors.
In this paper, we study change mining in the context of
association rules, i.e., to find rule changes that occur in the new
time period as compared to the old time period. Association rule
mining is defined as follows [2]: Let I = {il..... i~} be a set of
items, and D be a set of transactions. Each transaction consists of
a subset of items in I. An association rule is an implication of the
form X---~ Y, where X c I, YcL
andXn Y= f~. The rule X---) Y
holds in D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that
support X also support Y. The rule has support s in D if s% of
transactions in D contains X u
Y. The problem of mining
association rules is to generate all association rules that have
support and confidence greater than the user-specified minimum
support (minsup) and minimum confidence (minconf).
In this work, we focus on association rules mined from a
relational table, which consists of a set of tuples described by a
number of attributes. An item in this context is an attribute value
pair, i.e., (attribute = value) (numeric attributes are discretized).
Mining in such data is typically targeted at a specific attribute, as
the user normally wants to know how the other attributes are
related to this target attribute (which has a number of discrete
values) [3, 16]. With a target attribute, an association rule can be
expressed as: X ~ y, where y is an item (or a value) of the target
attribute, and X is a set of items from the rest of the attributes.
On the surface, finding changes of association rules generated
from data in two time periods is easy. We simply compare the
supports and confidences of each rule from the two time periods,
and then report the differences. This approach was taken by a
number of researchers [e.g., 1, 5, 8]. However, it has two major
problems. First, it often reports far too many changes and most of
them are simply the snowball effect of some fundamental changes.
Second, analyzing the difference in supports/confidences may
miss some interesting changes. For example, rule A,B---~y has
similar supports in time period tl and t2. However, the support of
A---)y and the support of B---~yhave both increased dramatically.
This is an interesting phenomenon and should be reported.
A more useful approach is to identify the small set of
fundamental changes (changes that cannot be explained by the
presence of other changes) and report only the fundamental
changes to the user. This makes sense because the fundamental




335

changes are typically those that require user attention. This paper
proposes a technique to identifythe set of fundamentalchanges in
two given datasets collected from two time periods. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time that such a technique is
proposed. We now use an example to illustrate the idea.

Example 1: Assume that the followingthree rules are mined from
the data of time period 1.
rl: Job = yes ~ Lean = approved [sup=3.2%, conf= 60%]
r2: Own_house = yes ---)Loan = approved
[sup=4.4%, conf = 40%]
r3
Job = yes, Own_house = yes ---)Loan = approved
[sup=2.6%, conf = 80%]
In time period 2, the three rules become:
rl': Job = yes ~ Loan = approved
[sup=5.0%, conf= 65%]
r2': Own_house = yes --) Loan = approved
[sup=5.3%, conf = 45%]
r3': Job = yes, Own_house = yes --->Loan = approved
[sup=4.2%, conf = 89%]
Focusing on the changes in support, we observe the following
facts. First, the proportion of people who have jobs and have
their loans approved increased significantly in time period 2.
Second, the proportion of people who own houses and have
their loans approved has also increased. Third, the proportion
of people who have jobs, own houses and have their loan
approved increased significantly as well. The question that we
would like to ask is: "is the increase in r3 (we use r3' and r3 in
time period 2 interchangeably)the consequenceof the increases
in rl and r2?" That is, can the increase in support of r3 be
explained in terms of the changes in support of rl and r2? If it
can be explained, then we say the change observed in r3 is not a
fundamentalchange. Intuitively,we can see that in this example
the support increase in r3 could be somehow explained by the
support increases in rl and r2. If, however, we have the
followingrule in time period 2 instead of r3',
r3": Job = yes, Own_house = yes --*Loan = approved
[sup= 2.2%, conf = 89%].
The decrease in support of r3 (r3") is hard to explain because
we would expect the support of r3 to increase given that the
supports of rl and r2 have both increased. In this case, we say
that the change observed in r3 is unexplainable,and represents
a fundamentalchange.
This paper proposes a technique to identify all such fundamental
changes - changes that cannot be explained by other changes.
Such rules are very interesting because they often represent some
major shifts in the domain. The proposed technique has been
evaluated using 10 real-life datasets. Experiment results show that
only a small subset of the rules exhibit fundamental changes in
support and/or confidence. They can be manually analyzed
without much difficulty. The user can then focus his/her attention
on those important/interestingaspects of changes, and selectively
view those less important or explainablechanges.


2. RELATED WORK
Mining or learning in a changing environmenthas been studied in
both data mining and machine learning. In data mining, [1, 5, 8]
address the problem of monitoring the support and confidence of
association rules. Given an association rule, their techniques track
the support and confidence variations of the rule over time. These
techniques basically belong to the simple approach mentioned in
Section 1. None of them aims to find fundamentalchanges.
A representative work of these techniques is the one reported
in [1]. The paper proposes to monitor rules in different time
periods. The discovered rules from different time periods are
collected into a rule base. Ups and downs in support or
confidence over time (called history) are represented and defined
using shape operators. The user can then query the rule base by
specifying some history specifications. Clearly, this is different
from our work, as it does not mine fundamentalrule changes.
[8] presents a general framework for measuring changes or
differences in two models (e.g., two sets of association rules from
two datasets).The framework does not mine fundamentalchanges.
[4, 9] study the maintenance of discovered association rules.
The techniques aim to incrementally update the rules when data
tuples are deleted or inserted. They do not mine explicit changes.
[6] proposes a method for spatial trend detection. A spatial
trend is defined as a regular change of one or more non-spatial
attributes when moving away from a given start object. This is
different from our work, as it is not concerned with rule changes.
[11] proposes a technique to compare high-dimensional
datasets. It first partitions the data into sections. Each section is
summarized with a profile, a set of statistics. The profiles from the
old data set and the new dataset are then compared using statistic
tests for proportions and for change of means. This work is also
different from ours, as it is not concerned with rule changes.
Our proposed
technique is in spirit related
to rule
summarization in [16] and finding the minimal set of unexpected
rules in [18]. Both techniques, however, do not deal with changes.
Another related research is the subjective interestingness in
data mining. [19, 14, 18] propose a number of approaches for
finding unexpected rules with respect to the user's expectations.
These techniques also do not deal with rule changes.
In machine learning, many researchers have studied how to
produce good classifiers (or concepts) in on-line learning of a
drifting environment [e.g., 20, 13]. Their framework is different
from ours, as they do not mine explicit drifts.


3. BASIC STEPS OF THE PROPOSED
APPROACH
Let the dataset from time period tl be DI and the dataset from time
period t2be D2. The technique consists of the followingtwo steps:

1. Rule generation: We first perform association rule mining on
each sub-dataset Di. Let the set of roles mined from Di be Ri.
We define R, the set of roles that we will use to find the
fundamentalchanges, as the union of the Ri's:
R= {rlr~ (RluR2)}
Clearly, a role r in R may appear in Ri but not in Rj (i 4=j)
because r may not satisfy the minsup and/or minconf in Dj.
However, in order to analyze the changes in rules, we need the
supports and confidences of every rule in R for both time
periods. Thus, the missing support and confidence information
in either time periods for each rule needs to be obtained. This
can be done easily. We can modify an association rule mining
algorithm in [2] slightly so that it can mine rules from both Dl
and D2 at the same time to produce R taking into consideration
of the required supports and confidences of each rule. Note
that we also perform rule pruning to remove those
insignificantrules. See the details on pruningin [16].
2. Identification of fundamental rule changes: This step finds
all fundamental rule changes. Recall we define a change as
fundamental if it cannot be explained by other changes. We




336

say a change is explainable if the observed relationship in tl
still holds in t2 taking into account any increase or decrease in
support or confidence of some related changes.

The rest of the paper will focus on step 2. Step 1 will not be
discussed any further as it is fairly straightforward.


4. FINDING FUNDAMENTAL RULE
CHANGES
This
section presents
the proposed
technique
for finding
fundamental rule changes. We distinguish two types of changes,
namely, those identified through quantitative analysis, and those
identified through qualitative analysis. Below, we first present
these two types of fundamental changes and the techniques for
identifying them, and then discuss two sub-sets of changes that
are of particular interest.


4.1 Finding Fundamental Rule Changes -
Quantitative Analysis
In quantitative analysis, we use a statistical test for homogeneity
to identify those unexplainable rule changes (or fundamental rule
changes). Basically, the change in support (or confidence) of a
rule is unexplainable or fundamental if the change is unexpected.

Definition 1 (expected supports or confidences): The expected
support (or confidence) of a rule r in t2 is defined as follows:
(1)
If r is a 1-condition rule, the expected support (or
confidence) of r in t2 is the support (or confidence) of r in
tt (i.e., r's support or confidence is expected to remain the
same from tt to t2 in the absence of prior knowledge).
(2)
If r is a k-condition rule r (k > 1) of the form,

r:
at, a2, ..., ak --->y
we view r as a combination of 2 rules, a 1-condition rule
roneand a (k-1)-condition rule rr~st,with the same target y:l

lone:
ai --->Y
Frest:
al, a2..... aj --->y
where {al, a2..... aj} = {at, a2..... at} - {ai}. Note that
there are k such combinations. Let supt(x) and conft(x) be
the support and confidence of rule x in time period t
respectively. Let Erone(SUpt2(r)) and Erre~t(supt2(r)) be the
expected supports of r in t2 with respect to tone and r,est.
Let Eron,(conft2(r)) and Erre~t(conft2(r)) be the expected
confidences of r in t2 with respect to ro,e and rre,t.
The expected supports and the expected confidences of
r with respect to ro,e and rreu are computed as follows:


E,o., (sup ,, (r)) = min [( supSUpt'(r,,) xsup ,, (ro,,),l )



E r
(sup,,(r)) = min I sup,,(r)
xsupt~(r,,~t ), 1]
"~'
[ sup t, ( r,,s, )
)

E ,_ (conf ,~(r )) = rrfin ([conf ,,c°n/" (rr, ) × conf ,, (ro,, ), l )


E,,,, (conf,~ (r)) = min I conf,, (r...2) ×conf,~ (G,,), 11
[ conf,, (r,,u )
)

we can alsoviewthe ruler as a combinationof morethantwo shorterrules.The
numbersof conditionsin the shorterrules do not haveto be 1 and k-l. but any
possible partition. However. these alternatives require mere computation.
Conceptually.theyarealsomoredifficulttounderstand.
The computation of the expected supports and confidences are
based on the Constant Proportion Assumption.

Constant
Proportion
Assumption
2:
The
proportional
relationships between rone and rrestto rule r should remain the
same from time period tl to time period t2, where t2 > ta.

This assumption is reasonable as it follows our intuition and
allows us to find those unexpected or unexplainable changes that
are important in practice.

Definition
2
(fundamental
rule
change
in
support
or
confidence via quantitative analysis): A change in support (or
confidence) of rule r from tt to t2 is said to be fundamental if:
(1)
r is a 1-condition rule and its support (or confidence) is
significantly
different from its expected support
(or
confidence), or
(2)
r is a k-condition rule r (k > 1), and for all rone and rrest
combinations, Erone(SUpt2(r)), Errest(suP,2(r)) and supt2(r)
are
significantly
different
(or
Erone(COnft2(r)),
Err,~t(conft2(r)) and conft2(r) are significantly different).

Note that (2) of Definition 2 basically says that if the change in r
can be explained by any one combination, it is not a fundamental
rule change. This is reasonable because as long as there is one
possible explanation for r's change, we cannot say that r is a
fundamental change. Notice also that in this definition, we need a
significance test. Here, we use the popular Chi-square test
statistics for the purpose (see Section 5).
Let us use an example to illustrate the above definitions.

Example 2: We have the following rules in time period 1:
rl:
Job = yes --->Loan = approved
[sup=5.2%, conf= 60%]
r2:
Own_house = yes --->Loan = approved
[sup=6.0%, conf = 40%]
r3
Job = yes, Own_house = yes --->Loan = approved
[sup=2.1%, conf = 80%]
In time period 2, the three rules become:
rl': Job = yes --->Loan = approved
[sup=4.4%, conf= 65%]
r2': Own_house = yes --> Loan = approved
[sup--4.3%, conf = 45%]
r3': Job = yes, Own_house = yes --->Loan = approved
[sup=4.2%, conf = 89%]

Since rl and r2 are 1-condition rules, we can use Chi-square test
to check whether the support (or confidence) of each of them in t2
is significantly different from that in tl. If so, it is a fundamental
rule change. We now focus on r3 (r3') in t2. Here, we only
evaluate the change in support (change in confidence can be
evaluated in the same way). The expected supports of r3 in t2with
respect to rl and r2 are 0,018 and 0.015 respectively.
Now with these two expected supports of r3 in t2, we can use
Chi-square test for homogeneity to check whether Ert(suPt2(r3)),
E,,z(suPt2(r3)), and the actual support of r3 in t2 (i.e., suPt2(r3)) are
significantly different.
Suppose
it turns
out that they are
statistically
different.
Then,
the
support
of
r3
in
t2 is
unexplainable, and it is a fundamental rule change in support.
Figure 1 gives the algorithm for finding fundamental rule
changes. The algorithm only shows the rule support evaluation.
Confidence evaluation can be done in exactly the same way.


We experimented with a number of other assumptions (ways to compute
expectations),buttheirresultswerelesssatisfactory.Theywerealsomeredifficult
to understand.

Line 1 initializes the variable FdmChanges for storing the set of
fundamental rule changes. Line 2 sets the loop to start evaluation
of each rule from the shortest rule to the longest rule. Line 3
produces every rone and rrestpair from r. Lines 4 & 5 compute
Eron,(supt2(r)) and E~,,t(suptz(r)), and perform the homogeneity
test (see Section 5) to determine whether the support of r in t2 can
be explained by roneand rrest.In lines 6-12, if r can be explained
by any of the ro~eand rrestpairs, it is not a fundamental change
(lines 6 & 7). Those fundamentalrule changes (line 11) are stored
in FdmChanges. In lines 6-12, if r can be explained by any of the
ro,, and rrestpairs, it is not a fundamental change (lines 6 & 7).
Fundamentalrule changes (line 11) are stored in FdmChanges.
Complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm is linear in the
number of discovered rules. See [15] for details.

4.2 Finding Fundamental Rule Changes -
Qualitative Analysis
We now identify fundamental changes via qualitative analysis.
Here, the magnitude of change is ignored. Instead we only focus
on the direction of change, i.e., increase, drop or noChange from
t~to t2. This set of rules is less interesting, but it enables us to find
two sub-sets of interestingrules, as we will see later.

Definition 3 (fundamental rule change in support/confidence
via qualitative analysis): The support (or confidence) change

in rule r from tl to tz, where r is a k-conditionrule (k > 1) 3, is



3 For l-conditional rules, qualitative analysis does not apply. They are evaluated by
quantitative analysis.
can be obtained easily by modifyingthe algorithm in Figure 1.

4.3 Some Interesting Subsets of Fundamental
Rule Changes
Note that Definition 2 and Definition 3 may result in different sets
of fundamental rule changes. They are both useful in practice. We
now discuss some interesting situations. We produce all the cases
of Definition3. To simplifyour discussion, we omit noChange, as
it is unlikely to occur in practice (but it can be easily included).
Without noChange, the total number of possible cases is reduced
to 8 (see Figure 3). Note that Case 7 and Case 8 are symmetric to
Case 5 and 6 respectively with respect to rone and rrest. We use
support change in our followingdiscussion.
Qualitatively, we observe that r's increase or drop in support
in Case 1 and Case 2 are intuitively sound. If two things increase
or drop, we would expect their combination to increase or drop
too. However, Cases 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are hard to explain.
Quantitative analysis, however, could conform to or conflict
with qualitative analysis. For instance, if a particular rule belongs
to Case 1 in Figure 3, it is thus explainable qualitatively.
However, if we take into consideration the magnitude of changes,
it becomes non-trivial. If the supports of roneand rre,t increase a
little and the support of r also increases a little, then quantitative
analysis may also show the rule is explainable. However, if the
actual support of r increases drastically, it may suggest that r is a
fundamental change, as the drastic increase cannot be explained
by the small increases in ron~and rrest.
This observation leads us to identify some interesting subsets
of fundamental rule changes. Let the set of fundamental rule
changes obtained from quantitative analysis be Fqt, and the set of
fundamental rule changes obtained from qualitative analysis be
Fqt, i.e., Cases 3-8. Two interesting subsets of fundamental rule
changes can be defined (these two subsets partition Fqt):
1. Fqt - Fqt: These rules are either 1-condition fundamental
change rules, or fall in Case 1 or Case 2 (i.e., their directions of
change are the same, but their magnitudes of change cannot be
explained). For example, for a particular rule r, its supt2(ron~)
increases to 5% from supq(ron,) = 4.8% and suptz(rr,,t) increases

to 6% from suPtt(rrest) = 5.6%. However, supt2(r) increases to
4% from suptl(r) = 1.5%. This situation falls into Case 1 above.
However, supq(r) = 4% is hard to explain as its increase is too




338

drastic. These rules are interesting because they represent some
relationship of disproportional increases. In applications, if we
want to achieve a big increase in r, we only need to perform
some actions to generate a small increase in rone and rrest.
2. Fqt n Fqt: These are rules (with 2 or more conditions)that have
changed dramatically, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
They belong to Cases 3-8 and their magnitudes of change are
also significant. These rules are most unexplainable, and they
warrant further analysis.


5. CHI-SQUARE TEST
For the proposed technique, we need a statistical test for
homogeneity of a set of proportions (support and confidence are

both proportions). Chi-square (X~)test [17] is a popular choice.

Test of homogeneity:
A test of homogeneity involves testing the
null hypothesis (H0) that the proportions, Pb P2..... pk, in two
or more populations are the same against the alternative
hypothesis (Hx)that these proportions are not the same. That is,
Ho:pl =P2 ..... Pk
H~: the population proportions are not all equal.

We assume that the data consists of independent random samples
of size nl, n2..... nk from k populations. The data is arranged in a
2xk contingency table (Figure 4). The numbers xl ..... xk, nl-xl,
.... nk-Xk listed inside the 2k cells are called observed frequencies
of the respective cells.

Figure 4: A 2xk contingencytable

Let O be an observed frequency, and E be an expected frequency
for a cell in the above table. The statistic defined as

,~2 = ~ (O
-
E) 2
E

has a Z2distribution with: df= (Row -1)(Column - 1), degrees of
freedom, where Row and Column are the number of rows and the
number of columns, respectively, in the given contingencytable.
Under the null hypothesis in a test of homogeneity, we would
expect the frequency E (expected frequency) for a cell to be as
follows [17]: (Row total)×(Columntotal)/Sample size.
Thus, X~represents a normalized deviation from expectation.
It works as follows: if all values were really homogeneous, the
value would be 0. If it is higher than a threshold value (5.99, at
the 95% significant level with two degrees of freedom) we reject
Ho, and state that the population proportions are significantly
different. Let us see an example.

Example
3: We use the three rules in Example 2. Assume the
dataset in time period 2 has 1000 tuples. Here, only support is
used as an example. The expected supports of r3 (r3') in time
period 2 with respect to rl and r2 are:
Erl(SuPt2(r3)) = 0.018, and Er2(Supt2(r3)) = 0.015.
We want to test the null hypothesis that Eq(supt2(r3)),

Er2($uPt2(r3)), and suPt2(r3) are the same statistically using the

significancelevel of 95% (a commonlyused level [17]).
All the support information can be presented in a 2x3
contingency table (Figure 5) containing 6 cells. The expected
frequencies are included in parentheses next to the observed
frequencies within the correspondingcells.

For the values in the table of Figure 5, the test statistic Z2 can be

the significancelevel of 95%, the critical value for X2is 5.99 with
2 degree of freedom (dr = (2-1)(3-1) = 2). The observed 3(2value
is much larger than the critical value. Thus, we reject the null
hypothesis, and conclude that the supports are significantly
different. We say that r3 shows an fundamentalchange in support.


6. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
We experimented the proposed technique on 3 real-life datasets
from three different domains. These datasets were collected by our
user organizations over a number of years. The first dataset is
from the education domain. We have 4 years of data. The second
set of data is from the insurance domain. We also have 4 years of
data. The last set is from the medical domain. We have 5 years of
patients' screening data. We group all the datasets into pair
groups (each pair group consists of data from two successive
years from their respective domains). This gives us 10 pair groups
of data. We mine the fundamentalchanges from each pair group.
Table 1 shows the summary of our experiment results using
quantitative analysis. Each column is explained below (the
average value for each column is shown in the last row):
Column 1 gives the name of each data group (with two years
of data). Column 2 gives the total number of rules in R from the
two years (see Section 3 for the definition of R) that satisfy the
minimum support
and minimum confidence requirements.
Column 3 gives the number of rules after pruning for each data
group. Pruning removes those non-significantrules. We apply the
pruning technique in [16]. Column 4 gives the number of
explainable confidence rules for each group, and column 5 gives
the number of significant rules that exhibit fundamental changes
in confidence through the quantitative analysis in Section 4.1. We
observe that the number of fundamental rule changes is quite
small. It is possible to manually analyze them. Column 6 shows
the ratio of column 5 vs. column 3. On average, the number of
rules that exhibit fundamental changes in confidence is only 23%
of the total number of rules. It is also interesting to note that the
education domain is very stable as the number of fundamentalrule
changes is consistently small over the years. The insurance
domain is the most volatile. Columns 7-9 show the same set of
results as columns 4-6, but for rule support changes. We can see
that only 34% of the rules exhibit fundamental changes. Column
10 gives the number of fundamental rule changes in both support
and confidence. Column 11 shows the rule generation time for
each data group. Column 12 gives the time used for finding
fundamental rule changes, i.e., the proposed technique in this
paper. It includes the time for both confidence and support change
evaluations through quantitative analysis and for finding (Fqt-Fq~)
and (Fqt ¢'~ Fql). We can see that these operations can be done
extremely efficiently. Columns 13 and 14 give the number of

were conducted on a PII-350 PC with 128MB RAM.
Table 2 gives the results of the two interesting subsets of
fundamentalrule changes, i.e., Fqt---Fqtand Fqt(3 Fqt.The table has
two parts. The first part (columns 2-4) gives the results for
fundamental confidence changes. The second part (columns 5-7)
gives the results for fundamentalsupport changes.

CONCLUSION
Detecting fundamental shifts in the environment is of crucial
importance to businesses. Companies constantly need to know
what are changing in the market place. This allows them to
produce the right products and/or services to suit the changing
market needs. Fundamental changes often require immediate
attention and action. In this paper, we studied this issue in the
context of association rules, and proposed an efficient technique
to identify fundamentalrule changes in support and in confidence.
Empirical evaluation showed that only a small percentage of rules
exhibit fundamental changes. This enables the users to analyze
them to obtain those actionablechanges without much difficulty.
