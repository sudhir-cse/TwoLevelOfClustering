ABSTRACT
Dimension reduction is critical for many database and data
mining applications, such as efficient storage and retrieval of
high-dimensional data. In the literature, a well-known di-
mension reduction scheme is Linear Discriminant Analysis
(LDA). The common aspect of previously proposed LDA
based algorithms is the use of Singular Value Decompo-
sition (SVD). Due to the difficulty of designing an incre-
mental solution for the eigenvalue problem on the product
of scatter matrices in LDA, there is little work on design-
ing incremental LDA algorithms. In this paper, we pro-
pose an LDA based incremental dimension reduction algo-
rithm, called IDR/QR, which applies QR Decomposition
rather than SVD. Unlike other LDA based algorithms, this
algorithm does not require the whole data matrix in main
memory. This is desirable for large data sets. More impor-
tantly, with the insertion of new data items, the IDR/QR
algorithm can constrain the computational cost by apply-
ing efficient QR-updating techniques. Finally, we evaluate
the effectiveness of the IDR/QR algorithm in terms of clas-
sification accuracy on the reduced dimensional space. Our
experiments on several real-world data sets reveal that the
accuracy achieved by the IDR/QR algorithm is very close
to the best possible accuracy achieved by other LDA based
algorithms. However, the IDR/QR algorithm has much less
computational cost, especially when new data items are dy-
namically inserted.

1. INTRODUCTION
Efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional data is
one of the central issues in database and data mining re-
search. In the literature, many efforts have been made to
design multi-dimensional index structures [2], such as R-
trees, R -trees, X-trees, SR-tree, etc, for speeding up query
processing. However, the effectiveness of queries using any
indexing schemes deteriorates rapidly as the dimension in-
creases, which is the so-called curse of dimensionality. A
standard approach to overcome this problem is dimension
reduction, which transforms the original high-dimensional
data into a lower-dimensional space with limited loss of in-
formation. Once the high-dimensional data is transfered
into a low-dimensional space, indexing techniques can be ap-
plied effectively to organize this low-dimensional space and
facilitate efficient retrieval of data [14].
A well-known dimension reduction scheme is Linear Dis-
criminant Analysis (LDA) [7, 9], which computes a linear
transformation by maximizing the ratio of the between-class
distance to the within-class distance, thereby achieving max-
imal discrimination. LDA has been applied to many appli-
cations such as text retrieval [3] and face recognition [1, 17,
21]. In the past, many LDA extensions have been developed
to deal with the singularity problem encountered by clas-
sical LDA. There are three major extensions: regularized
LDA, PCA+LDA, and LDA/GSVD. The common point of
these algorithms is the use of Singular Value Decomposi-
tion (SVD) or Generalized Singular Value Decomposition
(GSVD). The difference among these LDA members is as
follows: Regularized LDA increases the magnitude of the
diagonal elements of the scatter matrix by adding a scaled
identity matrix; PCA+LDA first applies PCA on the raw
data to get a more compact representation so that the singu-
larity of the scatter matrix is decreased; LDA/GSVD solves
a trace optimization problem using GSVD.
The above LDA algorithms have certain limitations. First,
SVD or GSVD requires that the whole data matrix is stored
in main memory. This requirement imposes difficulties on
making the LDA algorithms scalable to large data sets. Also,
the expensive computation of SVD or GSVD can signifi-
cantly degrade the computational performance of the LDA
algorithms when dealing with large data sets. Finally, since
it is difficult to design an incremental solution for the eigen-
value problem on the product of scatter matrices, little ef-
fort has been made to design incremental LDA algorithms.
However, in many practical applications, acquisition of rep-
resentative training data is expensive and time-consuming.
It is thus common to have a small chunk of data available

over a period of time. In such settings, it is necessary to de-
velop an algorithm that can run in an incremental fashion
to accommodate the new data.
The goal of this paper is to design an efficient and in-
cremental dimension reduction algorithm while preserving
competitive performance. More precisely, when queries are
conducted on the reduced dimension data from the proposed
algorithm, the query accuracy should be comparable with
the best possible query accuracy achieved by other LDA
based algorithms.
To resolve these issues, we design an LDA based incremen-
tal dimension reduction algorithm, called IDR/QR, which
applies QR Decomposition rather than SVD or GSVD. This
algorithm has two stages. The first stage is to maximize the
separability between different classes. This is fulfilled by QR
Decomposition. The distinct property of this stage is its low
time and space complexity. The second stage incorporates
both between-class and within-class information by applying
LDA on the "reduced" scatter matrices resulting from the
first stage. Unlike other LDA based algorithms, IDR/QR
does not require the whole data matrix in main memory.
This is desirable for large data sets. Also, our theoreti-
cal analysis indicates that the computational complexity of
IDR/QR is linear in the number of the data items in the
training set as well as the number of dimensions. More im-
portantly, the IDR/QR algorithm can work incrementally.
When new data items are dynamically inserted, the compu-
tational cost of the IDR/QR algorithm can be constrained
by applying efficient QR-updating techniques.
Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on sev-
eral well-known real-world datasets. The experimental re-
sults show that the IDR/QR algorithm can be an order of
magnitude faster than SVD or GSVD based LDA algorithms
and the accuracy achieved by IDR/QR is very close to the
best possible accuracy achieved by other LDA based algo-
rithms. Also, when dealing with dynamic updating, the
computational advantage of IDR/QR over SVD or GSVD
based LDA algorithms becomes more substantial while still
achieving comparable accuracy.
Overview: The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 introduces related work. In Section 3, we give a
review of LDA. The batch implementation of the IDR/QR
algorithm is presented in Section 4. Section 5 describes the
incremental implementation of the IDR/QR algorithm. A
comprehensive empirical study of the performance of the
proposed algorithms is presented in Section 6. We conclude
in Section 7 with a discussion of future work.



2. RELATED WORK
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the stan-
dard and well-known methods for dimension reduction [13].
Because of its simplicity and ability to extract the global
structure of a given data set, PCA is used widely in com-
puter vision [22].
Most previous work on PCA and LDA requires that all
the training data be available before the dimension reduc-
tion step. This is known as the batch method. There is some
recent work in vision and numerical linear algebra litera-
ture for computing PCA incrementally [4, 11]. Despite the
popularity of LDA in the vision community, there is little
work for computing it incrementally. The main difficulty is
the involvement of the eigenvalue problem on the product

of scatter matrices, which is hard to maintain incrementally.
Although iterative algorithms have been proposed for neural
network based LDA [5, 16], they require O(d2) time for each
update, where d is the dimension of the data. This is still
expensive, especially when the data has high dimension.


3. LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS
For convenience, we present in Table 1 the important no-
tations used in the paper.
This section gives a brief review of classical LDA, as well
as its three extensions: regularized LDA, PCA+LDA, and
LDA/GSVD.
Given a data matrix A  IRd
Оn
, we consider finding a
linear transformation G  IRd
О
that maps each column aj
of A, for 1  j  n, in the d-dimensional space to a vector
yj = GTaj in the -dimensional space.
Classical LDA aims to find the transformation G such
that class structure of original high-dimensional space is
preserved in the reduced space. Let the data matrix A be
partitioned into c classes as A = [A1,A2, иии ,Ac], where
Ai  IRd
Оni
, and
╚c
i=1
ni = n.
Let Ii be the set of column indices that belong to the ith
class, i.e., aj, for j  Ii, belongs to the ith class.
In general, if each class is tightly grouped, but well sep-
arated from the other classes, the quality of the cluster is
considered to be high. In discriminant analysis, two scatter
matrices, within-class and between-class scatter matrices are
defined to quantify the quality of the cluster, as follows [9]:


Sw =
c


i=1 jIi
(aj - mi)(aj - mi)T,


Sb =
c


i=1 jIi
(mi - m)(mi - m)T


=
c


i=1
ni(mi - m)(mi - m)T,


where mi is the centroid of the ith class and m is the global
centroid. Define the matrices

Hw = [A1 - m1 и eT1 ,иии ,Ac - mc и eTc ]  IRd
Оn
, (1)
Hb = [n1(m1 - m),иии ,nc(mc - m)]  IRd
Оc
,(2)

where ei = (1,иии , 1)T  IRni.

Then the scatter matrices Sw and Sb can be expressed as
Sw = HwHT
w
, Sb = HbHT
b
. The traces of the two scatter
matrices can be computed as follows,


trace (Sw) =
c


i=1 jIi
||aj - mi||2


trace (Sb) =
c


i=1
ni||mi - m||2.


Hence, trace (Sw) measures the closeness of the vectors within
classes, while trace (Sb) measures the separation between
classes.
In the lower-dimensional space resulting from the linear
transformation G, the within-class and between-class scatter
matrices become

SL
w
= (GTHw)(GTHw)T = GTSwG,
SL
b
= (GTHb)(GTHb)T = GTSbG.

An optimal transformation G would maximize trace (SL
b
)
and minimize trace (SL
w
). A common optimization in clas-
sical LDA [9] is

G = arg
max
gT
i
Swgj=0,i=j
trace (GTSwG)-
1
(GTSbG) , (3)


where gi is the ith column of G.
The solution to the optimization in Eq. (3) can be ob-
tained by solving the eigenvalue problem on S-
1
w
Sb, if Sw is
non-singular, or on S-
1
b
Sw, if Sb is non-singular. There are
at most c - 1 eigenvectors corresponding to nonzero eigen-
values, since the rank of the matrix Sb is bounded above by
c-1. Therefore, the reduced dimension by classical LDA is
at most c-1. A stable way to solve this eigenvalue problem
is to apply SVD on the scatter matrices. Details on this can
be found in [21].
Classical LDA requires that one of the scatter matrices
be non-singular. For many applications involving under-
sampled data, such as text and image retrieval, all scatter
matrices are singular. Classical LDA is thus not applicable.
This is the so-called singularity or undersampled problem.
To cope with this challenge, several methods, including two-
stage PCA+LDA, regularized LDA, and LDA/GSVD have
been proposed in the past.
A common way to deal with the singularity problem is
to apply an intermediate dimension reduction stage, such
as PCA, to reduce the dimension of the original data be-
fore classical LDA is applied. The algorithm is known as
PCA+LDA, or subspace LDA. In this two-stage PCA+LDA
algorithm, the discriminant stage is preceded by a dimension
reduction stage using PCA. A limitation of this approach is
that the optimal value of the reduced dimension for PCA is
difficult to determine.
Another common way to deal with the singularity problem
is to add some constant value to the diagonal elements of Sw,
as Sw + хId, for some х > 0, where Id is an identity matrix
[8]. It is easy to check that Sw + хId is positive definite,
hence non-singular. This approach is called regularized LDA
(RLDA). A limitation of RLDA is that the optimal value of
the parameter х is difficult to determine. Cross-validation
is commonly applied for estimating the optimal х [15].
The LDA/GSVD algorithm in [12, 23] is a recent work
along the same line. A new criterion for generalized LDA
was presented in [23]. The inversion of the matrix Sw is
avoided by applying the Generalized Singular Value Decom-
position (GSVD). LDA/GSVD computes the solution ex-
actly without losing any information. However, one limita-
tion of this method is the high computational cost of GSVD,
which limits its applicability for large datasets, such as im-
age and text data.


4. BATCH IDR/QR
In this section, we present the batch implementation of
the IDR/QR algorithm. This algorithm has two stages. The
first stage maximizes the separation between different classes
via QR Decomposition [10]. Without the concern of min-
imizing within-class distance, this stage can be used inde-
pendently as a dimension reduction algorithm. The second
stage addresses the concern on within-class distance, while
keeping low time/space complexity.
The first stage of IDR/QR aims to solve the following
optimization problem,

G = arg max
GT G=I
trace(GTSbG).
(4)

Note that this optimization only addresses the concern of
maximizing between-class distance. The solution can be ob-
tained by solving the eigenvalue problem on Sb. The solution
can also be obtained through QR Decomposition on the cen-
troid matrix C, which is the so-called Orthogonal Centroid
Method (OCM) [19], where

C = [m1,m2,иии ,mc]
(5)

consists of the c centroids. More specifically, let C = QR be
the QR Decomposition of C, where Q  IRn
Оc
has orthonor-
mal columns and R  IRc
Оc
is upper triangular. Then

G = QM
(6)

solves the optimization problem in Eq. (4), for any orthog-
onal matrix M. Note the choice of orthogonal matrix M is
arbitrary, since trace(GTSbG) = trace(MTGTSbGM), for
any orthogonal matrix M. In OCM [19], M is set to be the
identity matrix for simplicity.
The second stage of IDR/QR refines the first stage by
addressing the concern on within-class distance. It incor-
porates the within-class scatter information by applying a
relaxation scheme on M in Eq. (6) (relaxing M from an or-
thogonal matrix to an arbitrary matrix). Note that the trace
value in Eq. (3) is the same for an arbitrary non-singular M,
however the constraints in Eq. (3) will not be satisfied for
arbitrary M. In the second stage of IDR/QR, we look for
a transformation G such that G = QM, for some M. Note
that M is not required to be orthogonal. The original prob-
lem on computing G is equivalent to computing M. Since

GTSbG = MT(QTSbQ)M,
GTSwG = MT(QTSwQ)M,

the original optimization on finding optimal G is equivalent
to finding M, with B = QTSbQ and W = QTSwQ as the
reduced between-class and within-class scatter matrices, re-
spectively. Note that B has much smaller size than the
original scatter matrix Sb (similarly for W).
The optimal M can be computed efficiently using many
existing LDA based methods, since we are dealing with ma-
trices B and W of much smaller size c by c. A key obser-
vation is that the singularity problem of W will not be as

than Sw. We can compute optimal M by simply apply-
ing regularized LDA, that is, we compute M, by solving a
small eigenvalue problem on (W + хIc)-

B, for some posi-
tive constant х. The pseudo-code for this algorithm is given
in Algorithm 1.

4.1 Time and space complexity
We close this section by analyzing the time and space
complexity of the IDR/QR algorithm.
It takes O(dn) for the formation of the centroid matrix C
in Line 1. The complexity for QR Decomposition in Line 2
is O(c2d) [10]. Lines 3 and 4 take O(ndc) and O(dc2) respec-
tively for matrix multiplications. It then takes O(c2n) and
O(c3) for matrix multiplications in Lines 5 and 6, respec-
tively. Line 7 computes the eigen-decomposition of a c by
c matrix, hence takes O(c3) [10]. The matrix multiplication
in Line 8 takes O(dc2).
Note that the dimension, d, and the number, n, of points
are usually much larger, compared with the number, c, of
classes. Thus, the most expensive step in Algorithm 1 is in
Line 3, which takes O(ndc). Therefore, the time complexity
of IDR/QR is linear in the number of points, linear in the
number of classes, and linear in the dimension of the dataset.
It is clear that only the c centroids are required to reside in
the main memory, hence the space complexity of IDR/QR is
O(dc). Table 2 lists the time and space complexity of several
dimension reduction algorithms discussed in this paper. It
is clear from the table that IDR/QR and OCM are more
efficient than other methods.


5. INCREMENTAL IDR/QR
The incremental implementation of the IDR/QR algo-
rithm is discussed in details in this section. We will adopt
the following convention: For any variable X, its updated
version after the insertion of a new instance is denoted by
~
X. For example, the number, ni, of elements in the ith class
is changed to ~
ni, while centroid mi is changed to ~
mi.
With the insertion of a new instance, the centroid ma-
trix C, Hw and Hb will change accordingly, as well as W
and B. The incremental updating in IDR/QR proceeds in
three steps: (1) QR-updating of the centroid matrix C =
[m1, иии ,mk] in Line 2 of Algorithm 1; (2) Updating of
the reduced within-class scatter matrix W in Line 5; and
(3) Updating of the reduced between-class scatter matrix B
in Line 6.
Let x be a new instance inserted, which belongs to the
ith class. Without loss of generality, let us assume we have
data from the 1st to the kth class, just before x is inserted.
In general, this can be done by switching the class labels
between different classes. In the rest of this section, we con-
sider the incremental updating in IDR/QR in two distinct
cases: (1) x belongs to an existing class, i.e., i  k; (2) x
belongs to a new class, i.e., i > k. As will be seen later, the
techniques for these two cases are quite different.

5.1 Insertion of a new instance from an exist-
ing class (i  k)
Recall that we have data from the 1st to kth classes, when
a new instance x is being inserted. Since x belongs to the ith
class, with 1  i  k, the insertion of x will not create a new
class. In this section, we show how to do the incremental
updating in three steps.

5.1.1 Step 1: QR-updating of the centroid matrix C
Since the new instance x belongs to the ith class,
~
C =
[m1, иии ,mi+f,иии ,mk], where f =
x-mi
~
ni
, and ~
ni = ni+1.

Hence,
~
C can be rewritten as
~
C = C + f и gT, for g =
(0,иии , 1,иии ,0)T, where the 1 appears at the ith position.
The problem of QR-updating of the centroid matrix C can
be formulated as follows: Given the QR Decomposition of
the centroid matrix C = QR, for Q  IRd
Оk
and R  IRk
Оk
,
compute the QR Decomposition of
~
C.
Since
~
C = C + f и gT, the QR-updating of the centroid
matrix C can be formulated as a rank-one QR-updating.
However, the algorithm in [10] cannot be directly applied,
since it requires the complete QR Decomposition, i.e., the
matrix Q is square. While in our case, we use the skinny QR
Decomposition, i.e. Q is rectangular. Instead, we apply a
slight variation of the algorithm in [6] via the following two-
stage QR-updating: (1) A complete rank-one updating as in
[10] on a small matrix; (2) A QR-updating by an insertion
of a new row. Details are given below.
Partition f into two parts: the projection onto the orthog-
onal basis Q, and its orthogonal complement. Mathemati-
cally, f can be partitioned into f = QQTf +(I -QQT)f. It
is easy to check that QT(I -QQT)f = 0, i.e. (I -QQT)f is
orthogonal to, or lies in the orthogonal complement of, the
subspace spanned by the columns of Q. It follows that

~
C = C + f и gT
= QR + QQTf и gT + (I - QQT)f и gT
= Q(R + f1 и gT) + f2 и gT,

where f1 = QTf, f2 = (I - QQT)f. Next, we show how
to compute the QR Decomposition of
~
C in two stages. The



367
Research Track Paper

first stage updates the QR Decomposition of Q(R+f1 иgT).
It corresponds to a rank-one updating and can be done at
O(kd) [10]. This results in the updated QR Decomposition
as Q(R+f1иgT) = Q1R1, where Q1 = QP1, and P1  IRk
Оk

is orthogonal.
Assume ||f2|| = 0. Denote q =
f2
||f2||
. Since q is orthogonal
to the subspace spanned by the columns of Q, it is also
orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the columns of Q1 =
QP1, i.e. [Q1,q] has orthonormal columns.
The second stage computes QR-updating of


~
C = [Q1,q]
R1
||f2||gT
,


which corresponds to the case that ||f2||gT is inserted as a
new row. This stage can be done at O(dk) [10]. The updated
QR Decomposition is


[Q1,q]
R1
||f2||gT
= [
~
Q, ~
q]
~
R
0
=
~
Q
~
R,


where [
~
Q, ~
q] = [Q1,q]P2, for some orthogonal matrix P2.
Combining both stages, we have


~
C = Q1R1 + ||f2||q и gT = [Q1,q]
R1
||f2||gT
=
~
Q
~
R


as the updated QR Decomposition of
~
C, assuming ||f2|| = 0.
If ||f2|| = 0, then
~
C = Q1R1 is the updated QR Decompo-
sition of
~
C. Note that f2 can be computed efficiently as
f2 = f - (Q(QTf)), by doing matrix-vector multiplication
twice. Hence, the total time complexity for the QR-updating
of the centroid matrix C is O(dk).

5.1.2 Step 2: Updating of W
Next we consider the updating of the reduced within-class
scatter matrix W = QTHwHT
w
Q (Line 5 of Algorithm 1).
Let
~
W =
~
QT
~
Hw
~
HT
w

Q be its updated version.
Note that Hw = [A1 -m1 иeT1 , иии ,Ak -mk иeTk ]  IRd
Оn
.
Its updated version
~
Hw differs from Hw on the ith block.
Let the ith block of Hw be Hi = Ai - mi и eTi . Then the ith
block of its updated version
~
Hw is

~
Hi =
~
Ai - ~
mi и ~
eTi = [Ai,x] - ~
mi и ~
eTi
= [Ai - mi и eTi ,x - mi] - ( ~

= [Hi,u] - v и ~

(7)


where u = x - mi, v = ~

The product

can be computed as

+ u и uT - v и uT - u и vT + (ni + 1)v и vT
= HiHT
i
+ (u - v) и (u - v)T + niv и vT,
(8)

where the third equality follows, since (Hi,u)~
ei =
╚
jIi
(aj-
mi)+u = u, and (vи~
eTi )(~
eiиvT) = vvT(~
eTi и~

Since HwHT

where ~
u =

approximation in Eq. (9) is that the updated
~
Q with the
insertion of a new instance is close to Q.
The computation of ~
u and ~

putation for updating W takes O(dk).

5.1.3 Step 3: Updating of B
Finally, let us consider the updating of the reduced between-
class scatter matrix B = QTHbHT
b
Q (Line 6 of Algorithm 1).
Its updated version is B =
~
QT
~
Hb
~
HT
b
~
Q.
The key observation for efficient updating of B is that

~
Hb = [

~
n1( ~
m1 - ~
m),иии ,

~
nk( ~
mk - ~
m)]

can be rewritten as

~
Hb = [ ~
m1, ~
m2,иии , ~
mk, ~
m]F = [
~
C, ~
m]F,


where F =
D
-hT
, D = diag(

~
n1,иии ,

~
nk), and h =

[

~
n1,иии ,

~
nk]T.
By the updated QR Decomposition
~
C =
~
Q
~
R, we have

~
QT
~
Hb = [
~
QT
~
C,
~
QT ~
m]F = [
~
R,
~
QT ~
m]F =
~

~
QT ~
m и hT.

It is easy to check that ~
m =
1
~
n
~
Cиr, where r = (~
n1,иии , ~
nk)T.
Hence,
~
QT ~
m =
~
QT

~

~
C и r =

~
R и r. It follows that

~
B =

Q = (

.

Therefore, it takes O(k3) time for updating B.
Overall, the total time for QR-updating of C and updating
of W and B with the insertion of a new instance from an
existing class is O(dk + k3). The pseudo-code is given in
Algorithm 2.

5.2 Insertion of a new instance from a new
class (i > k)
Recall that we have data from the 1st to kth classes, upon
the insertion of x. Since x belongs to ith class, with i > k,
the insertion of x will result in a new class. Without loss
of generality, let us assume i = k + 1. Hence the (k + 1)th
centroid ~
mk
+1
= x. Then the updated centroid matrix
~
C =
[m1,m2,иии ,mk,x] = [C,x]. In the following, we focus on

5.2.1 Step 1: QR-updating of the centroid matrix C
Given the QR Decomposition C = QR, it is straightfor-
ward to compute the QR Decomposition of
~
C as
~
C =
~
Q
~
R
by the Gram-Schmidt procedure [10], where
~
Q = [Q,q], for
some q. The time complexity for this step is O(dk).

5.2.2 Step 2: Updating of W
With the insertion of x from a new class (k + 1), the
(k + 1)th block
~
Hk
+1
is created, while Hj, for j = 1,иии ,k
keep unchanged. It is easy to check that
~
Hk
+1
= 0. It
follows that
~

The assumption in the above approximation is that W is

5.2.3 Step 3: Updating of B

Hb = [

Then
~
B can be computed by similar arguments as in the
previous case. Therefore, it takes O(k3) for updating B.
Thus, the time for QR-updating of C and updating of W
and B with the insertion of a new instance from a new class
is O(dk + k3). The pseudo-code is given in Algorithm 3.

5.3 Main algorithm
With the above two incremental updating schemes, the
incremental IDR/QR works as follows: For a given new in-
stance x, determine whether it is from an existing or new
class; If it is from an existing class, update the QR Decom-
position of the centroid matrix C and W and B by applying
Algorithm 2; otherwise update the QR Decomposition of
the centroid matrix C and W and B by applying Algo-
rithm 3; The above procedure is repeated until all points
are considered. With the final updated
~
W and
~
B, we can
compute the
~
k eigenvectors {i}~ki
=1
of (
~
W + хI~k)-
1
~
B, and
assign [1,иии ,~k] to M, where
~
k is the (updated) number
of classes (~
k equals k, if x is from an existing, and k + 1
otherwise). Then the transformation G =
~
QM, assuming
~
C =
~
Q
~
R is the updated QR Decomposition.
The incremental IDR/QR proposed obeys the following
general criteria for an incremental learning algorithm [20]:
(1) It is able to learn new information from new data; (2) It
does not require access to the original data; (3) It preserves
previously acquired knowledge; (4) It is able to accommo-
date new classes that may be introduced with new data.


6. EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate both the batch version and
the incremental version of the IDR/QR algorithm. The per-
formance is mainly measured by the computational cost in
terms of the classification accuracy and execution time. In

Figure 1: Comparison of classification accuracy on four test data sets


the experiment, we applied the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)
method [7] as the classification algorithm and classification
accuracies are estimated by 10-fold cross validation.
Experimental Platform: All experiments were per-
formed on a PC with a P4 1.8GHz CPU and 1GB main
memory running a Linux operating system.
Experimental Data Sets: Our experiments were per-
formed on the following four real-world data sets, which are
from two different application domains, including face recog-
nition and text retrieval. Some characteristics of these data
sets are shown in Table 3.

1. AR1 is a popular face image data set [18]. The face
images in AR contain a large area of occlusion, due to
the presence of sun glasses and scarves, which leads to
a relatively large within-class variance in the data set.
In our experiments, we use a subset of the AR data
set. This subset contains 1638 face images of entire
face identities (126). The image size of this subset is
768О576. We first crop the image from row 100 to 500,
column 200 to 550, and then subsample the cropped
images down to a size of 101 О 88 = 8888.

2. ORL2 is another popular face image data set, which
includes 40 face identities, i.e., 40 classes. The face
images in ORL only contain pose variation, and are
perfectly centralized/localized. The image size of ORL
is 92 О 112 = 10304. All dimensions (10304) are used
to test our dimension reduction algorithms.

6.1 The performance of batch IDR/QR
In this experiment, we compare the performance of the
batch IDR/QR with several other dimension reduction algo-
rithms including PCA+LDA, LDA/GSVD, OCM, and PCA.
Note that IDR/QR applies regularization to the reduced
within-class scatter, i.e., W + хIc. We chose х = 0.5 in our
experiments, while it produced good overall results.

6.1.1 Classification Accuracy

test data sets using five different dimension reduction algo-
rithms. Main observations are as follows:

и The most interesting result is from the AR data set.
We can observe that batch IDR/QR, PCA+LDA and
LDA/GSVD significantly outperform other two dimen-
sion reduction algorithms, PCA and OCM, in terms of
the classification accuracy. Recall that the face images
in the AR data set contain a large area of occlusion,
which results in the large within-class variance in each
class. The effort of minimizing of the within-class vari-
ance achieves distinct success in this situation. How-
ever, neither PCA nor OCM has the effort in minimiz-
ing the within-class variance. This explains why they
have a poor classification performance on AR.

и Another interesting observation is that OCM performs
well on text data sets. This observation is likely due
to the fact that text data sets tend to have relatively
small within-class variances. This observation suggests
that OCM is a good choice in practice if the data is
known to have small within-class variances.

6.1.2 Efficiency in computing the transformation
Figure 2 shows the execution time (in log-scale) of differ-
ent tested methods for computing the transformation. Even
with log-scale presentation, we can still observe that the ex-
ecution time for computing the transformation by IDR/QR
or OCM is significantly smaller than that by PCA+LDA,
LDA/GSVD, and PCA.

6.1.3 The Effect of Small Reduced Dimension
Here, we evaluate the effect of small reduced dimension
on the classification accuracy using the AR data set. Recall
that the reduced dimension by the IDR/QR algorithm is c,
where c is the number of classes in the data set. If the value c
is large (such as AR, which contains 126 classes), the reduced
representation may not be suitable for efficient indexing and
retrieval. Since the reduced dimensions from IDR/QR are
ordered by their discriminant powers (see Line 7 of Algo-
rithm 1), an intuitive solution is to choose the first few
dimensions in the reduced subspace from IDR/QR. The ex-
perimental results are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen,
the accuracy achieved by keeping the first 20 dimensions
only is still sufficiently high.

mental IDR/QR with that of batch IDR/QR in terms of

classification accuracy and the computational cost. We ran-
domly order the data items in the data set and insert them
into the training set one by one incrementally with the given
order. The remaining data is used as the test set. Initially,
we select the first 30% data items as the training set. Incre-
mental updating is then performed with the remaining data
items inserted one at a time.
Figure 4 shows the achieved classification accuracies by
batch IDR/QR and incremental IDR/QR on four data sets.
In the figure, the horizontal axis shows the portion of train-
ing data items, and the vertical axis indicates the classifica-
tion accuracy (as a percentage). We observe a trend that the
accuracy increases when more and more training data items
are involved. Another observation is that the accuracy by in-
cremental IDR/QR is quite close to that by batch IDR/QR.
Indeed, on four data sets, the maximal accuracy deviation
between incremental IDR/QR and batch IDR/QR is within
4%. Recall that incremental IDR/QR is carried through
QR Decomposition in three steps: (1) QR-updating of the
centroid matrix C; (2) Updating of the reduced within-class
scatter W; and (3) Updating of the reduced between-class
scatter B. The first and third steps are based on the exact
scheme, while the second step involves approximation. Note
that the main rationale behind our approximation scheme
in updating W is that the change of Q matrix is relatively
small and can be neglected for each single updating, where
C = QR is the QR Decomposition of C.
To give a concrete idea of the benefit of using incremental
IDR/QR from the perspective of efficiency, we give a com-
parison on the compuational cost between batch IDR/QR
and incremental IDR/QR. The experimental results are given
in Figure 5. As can be seen, the execution time of incre-
mental IDR/QR is significantly smaller than that of batch
IDR/QR. Indeed, for a single updating, incremental IDR/QR
takes O(dk+k3), while batch IDR/QR takes O(ndk), where
k is the number of classes in the current training set and n
is the size of the current training set. The time for a sin-
gle updating in incremental IDR/QR is almost a constant
O(dc + c3), when all classes appear in the current training
set, and the speed-up of incremental IDR/QR over batch
IDR/QR keeps increasing when more points are inserted
into the training set. Note that we only count the time
for Lines 1Г6 in Algorithm 1, since each updating in in-
cremental IDR/QR only involves the updating of the QR
Decomposition (Line 2), W (Line 5) and B (Line 6).

7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have proposed an LDA based incremen-
tal dimension reduction algorithm, called IDR/QR, which
applies QR Decomposition rather than SVD. The IDR/QR
algorithm does not require whole data matrix in main mem-
ory. This is desirable for large data sets. More importantly,
the IDR/QR algorithm can work incrementally. In other
words, when new data items are dynamically inserted, the
computational cost of the IDR/QR algorithm can be con-
strained by applying efficient QR-updating techniques. In
addition, our theoretical analysis indicates that the compu-
tational complexity of the IDR/QR algorithm is linear in
the number of the data items in the training data set as
well as the number of classes and the number of dimen-
sions. Finally, our experimental results show that the accu-
racy achieved by the IDR/QR algorithm is very close to the
best possible accuracy achieved by other LDA based algo-
rithms. However, the IDR/QR algorithm can be an order
of magnitude faster. When dealing with dynamic updat-
ing, the computational advantage of IDR/QR over SVD or
GSVD based LDA algorithms becomes more dramatic while
still achieving the comparable accuracy.
As for future research, we plan to investigate the appli-
cations of the IDR/QR algorithm on searching extremely
high-dimenional multimedia data, such as video.
