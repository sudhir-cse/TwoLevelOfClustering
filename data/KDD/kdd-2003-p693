ABSTRACT
One of the major hurdles in maintaining long-lived electronic
systems is that electronic parts become obsolete, no longer
available from the original suppliers.
When this occurs, an
engineer is tasked with resolving the problem by finding a
replacement that is "as similar as possible" to the original part.
The current approach involves a laborious manual search through
several electronic portals and data books. The search is difficult
because potential replacements may differ from the original and
from each other by one or more parameters. Worse still, the
cumbersome nature of this process may cause the engineers to
miss appropriate solutions amid the many thousands of parts listed
in industry catalogs.

In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the notion
of a parametric "distance" between electronic components. We
use this distance to search a large parts data set and recommend
likely replacements. Recommendations are based on an adaptive
nearest-neighbor search through the parametric data set. For each
user, we learn how to scale the axes of the feature space in which
the nearest neighbors are sought. This allows the system to learn
each user's judgment of the phrase "as similar as possible."

1. INTRODUCTION
The motivating application for the work described in this paper is
the search for "similar" electronic parts to replace electronic parts
that are no longer available from their original sources. In this
context, we use a nearest neighbor technique to identify parts that
are parametrically most similar. This alone is novel in the state-
of-practice. We extend this further by allowing the feature space
to dynamically adapt to each individual user. We describe a new
method for this adaptation.

1.1 Obsolete Part Problem
In the current world of high-tech electronic gadgets, the lifecycle
of a typical electronic part can run as short as 18 months. This
poses a significant challenge to the U.S. government and its
technology suppliers as products for the government market are
many years in development and testing and, once deployed, are
typically fielded for 10 to 20 years. During that time, additional
devices must often be built and fielded devices must often be
repaired.

Suppliers, repair depots, and technicians in the field need access
to a supply of components found in a military system. When a
component is no longer available through the original source, then
it is deemed "obsolete" and a process is put in place for
resolution. By the year 2000, the obsolescence rate had risen to
over 66,000 electronic components per year [1].

1.2 Current State of the Art in Obsolete Parts
Resolution
For the purposes of this paper, we will denote as an "Application
Engineer", or simply AE, the person responsible for resolving the
obsolete parts problem. It is important to note that there are many
AEs addressing the resolution of the same obsolete part. These
AEs are distributed among the various government product
suppliers and supply depots as well as field technicians. Further,
as each AE is potentially addressing the problem in a different
context (a given obsolete part is a component in many different
electronic devices), there will be many different resolutions. The
part that one AE selects for one application, may be an
inappropriate resolution for another.

In order to resolve a particular obsolete part problem, the AE must
first gather all of the parametric information describing the
obsolete part and then search for possible replacement parts with
which the system will be able to function as designed. Currently,
there is no single on-line source for this data. There are web sites
maintained by individual manufacturers, aftermarket suppliers,
parts distributors, and others. At each of these sites, the AE must

submit a query and evaluate and compare the results. Few of
these sites allow searching on parametric data and even fewer will
return close matches.

In response to this problem, a group of companies, including
Sarnoff Corporation, Rockwell Collins, Altarum, and Aquilent,
have been working with the Defense Sustainment Consortium,
funded by the Defense Logistics Agency, to create an "ePortal for
Parts Acquisition" which will be a single point of entry for AEs.
This ePortal will allow an AE to search a number of
heterogeneous, distributed parts databases with a single query and
receive the results in a unified format for easy comparison.

As is the case with all large data sets, searching for the right
information becomes a challenge. This is especially true when the
search is for a close neighbor and when different users have
different notions of closeness.
This paper describes the
development of a personalized tool that will reduce the cost of
finding a resolution and will improve the chances of finding the
best replacement.

2. SEARCH BASED ON ADAPTIVE USER
PROFILE
Our approach to dealing with this particular information overload
problem is to define a distance measure between the obsolete part,
called the target, and each of the other parts in a large data set.
This distance measure is guided by a user profile.
Potential
replacement parts are sorted by distance and presented to the user.
Feedback, obtained when the user selects an acceptable
replacement part, is used to update the user profile.

A block diagram of our application algorithm is shown in Figure
1. Block 1 obtains a parametric description of the target. Block 2
provides a high-level filtering of the entire catalog of data (all
heterogeneous parts databases taken together) to remove parts that
are clearly unacceptable (can't replace a memory chip with a
voltage regulator).
Blocks 3-7 represent calculation and
presentation of the distance measure, feedback, and profile
adaptation.

2.1 Parametric Distance
The distance between any two parts is a weighted combination of
parameter difference functions across all parameters. The weights
represent the user profile. Each user will have a different set of
weights and these weights will adapt, over time, in response to
feedback obtained from the user. The difference functions are
determined by domain experts1 to appropriately represent
differences in each parameter (e.g., What is the "cost" of replacing
an ceramic package with a plastic package?
Is this cost
commutative?)

The problem of defining distance measures for non-numeric
features has been studied in other contexts as well ([3], [4]).
Stanfill and Waltz [4] used a "value difference metric", a non-
Euclidean distance metric for working with symbolic features,
which says two values are similar if they occur with the same
relative frequency for all classifications.
For the ith parameter, we define a parameter difference measure,
di, between parts Pa and Pb,

Each parameter difference is normalized such that differences
measured along a number of different parameters can be
meaningfully compared and combined.

One example of parameter difference function for a numeric-
valued parameter is the absolute difference between the parameter
values. For non-numeric-valued parameters, the difference
functions are more difficult to specify and require the assistance
from the domain experts.

The parametric distance, D(a,b), between two parts is then some
weighted combination of these parameter difference measures. In
this paper we use the weighted summation in which case the part
distance is a linear combination of parameter differences,

2.2 User Profile
The need to maintain explicit user profiles is especially relevant to
systems that recommend items to users, from Web pages to music
[5], [6], [7], [8]. Traditionally, these profiles are based on simple
vector representations of data.

Our profile, assuming n physical and functional attributes or
parameters, is represented as a set of weights, i.e. an n-
dimensional vector  = [1, 2, ... i, ... n]. These weights are
real, non-negative numbers constrained to be less than, or equal to
some number m:
0.0    m.
Each element of the weight vector can be interpreted as indicating
the relative importance of the corresponding parameter in
determining the similarity of two parts. Parameters with larger
weights are considered more important in this determination.

2.3 Profile Adaptation: Bubble Up Algorithm
Profile adaptation is based on user feedback. User feedback based
on user selection, sometimes referred to as clickthrough data, have
been analyzed in the KDD community to learn ranking functions
[9]. As in that work, we also rely on the idea that clickthrough
data gives us partial information about the user's judgments
regarding relevance.

We obtain feedback when the user selects one of the parts on the
list as an appropriate replacement for the target and the selected

part is not the first item presented. In other words, we obtain
feedback when the selected item was not the part that had the
minimum distance to the target part. An example of this feedback
is shown below where D(t,a) < D(t,b) < D(t,c) < D(t,d) and part Pd
is selected by the user.

Parametric
Distance
Selected


Pa
D(t,a)
No

Pb
D(t,b)
No

Pc
D(t,c)
No

Pd
D(t,d)
Yes

This feedback is used to modify the values of the parameter
weights such that, if the same query were run again, part Pd would
be found earlier in the part ranking.

The selection of part Pd and rejection of parts Pa, Pb, and Pc give
us the following three elements of feedback.

1. D(t,a) < D(t,d) but D(t,d) should have been smaller
2. D(t,b) < D(t,d) but D(t,d) should have been smaller
3. D(t,c) < D(t,d) but D(t,d) should have been smaller

We cannot reach any conclusions about the relationships between
the three unselected parts (e.g., between Pa, and Pb), nor can we
form any conclusions about other parts further down the list
below Pd, as they may not have been examined by the user.
The goal of the adaptation algorithm is to modify the parameter
weights in response to the three statements above.
We can
imagine addressing all three simultaneously, but the algorithm
presented here addresses them individually starting with the part
one position higher than the selected part on the sorted list. Once
the weights have been changed, we recalculate the distances and
iterate. As the iterations proceed, the selected part "bubbles up"
through the list. Thus, we fondly call this algorithm the Bubble
Up algorithm2.

The stopping criterion for the iterations can include the
following: stop when the change in the weights has reached a
maximum, stop when the selected part appears higher than some
threshold ranking in the sorted list, and stop when each item from
the feedback set has been examined at least once.

The Bubble Up algorithm can be simply stated in the pseudo code
statements below where {Pf} is the set of parts involved in the
feedback, that is, the set of parts ranked higher than that selected.

Ps = selected part
while ( not stop )
set Pf | ( rank( Pf ) = rank( Ps ) ­ 1 )
 = modify( , Ps, Pf, Pt )

minimize the change to the weights necessary to effect the desired

our work that are not described here. Refer to [2] for the details.
change in rank order.
In the first iteration of the example, the
algorithm makes the minimum change in the weights such that
D'(t,d) < D'(t,c). Here we've introduced the distance D'(·) to
indicate the part distance between the two parts after we modify
the weights.

By minimum change in the weights we mean that we will
minimize the maximum change across all parameters. It can be
shown that one way to do this is to change all the weights by the
same amount, . If we specify the amount by which D'(t,d) <
D'(t,c), we essentially require that D'(t,d) ­ D'(t,c) = -k where k is
a positive number.
Since the parametric distances are linear
combinations of parameter distances, we can derive the required
value of  as follows.

Note that with =0, as is the case prior to modification, the sum
on the left-hand side of Equation 2 evaluates to a positive number
while the target on the right, -k, is a negative number. In order to
make the sum more negative, we wish to add  to those i
corresponding to negative values of gi and to subtract  from
those i corresponding to positive values of gi. This can be
formalized by representing gi as

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We have tested various algorithms with simulated users and both
synthetic data and real data. This testing, detailed in [2], allowed
for some fine tuning of the algorithms. Once we were satisfied
with the system performance on simulated data, we ran
experiments with real electronic parts data and parts selection data
provided by actual Application Engineers. In this section we
describe these real-user tests.

The parts data consisted of 4842 Static RAM (SRAM) parts, each
described by 25 parameters. This data, provided by Information
Handling Services (IHS), is a snapshot of the data available
through their CAPS Expert product.
Given the time consuming nature of finding replacement parts, we
limited our testing to four searches. Four parts from the data set
were artificially marked as obsolete. These were used by each of
three users (all professional AEs) who were asked to find
acceptable replacements. The AEs accessed the data through the
CAPS Expert interface.
Independently, we downloaded the
data set to our local system for analysis of our algorithms.

3.1 Method
We evaluate our algorithms in three stages. First, in Section 3.3,
we use a default profile, initialized so that all parameters are
weighted equally. Given each of the target parts, we use this
default profile to rank the entire database of parts and then
identify where, on that list, the selections of the users lie. This
will give an indication of the utility of a static parametric distance
function. We then allow the profile to adapt in response to user
selections. In many cases, each user has identified two acceptable
solutions for each target part. It is not uncommon, in fact, for an
engineer searching for solutions to identify multiple options. In
the Section 3.4 below, we provide our system one user-specified
solution, allow the system to adapt to that feedback, and then
observe the change in ranking of the second user-specified
solution using the adapted profile. Finally, in Section 3.5, we
allow the system to adapt to two target / selection pairs and then
observe the change in ranking of the parts selected to replace the
third target.

3.2 User Data
Rather than list the manufacturers part names, we will reference
each part by the index number from our data set.

The four target parts have indices, 4823, 4827, 4838, and 4839.

For the first of these four parts we have data from three users
regarding acceptable replacements in the data set. For the other
three parts, we have data from two users. These data are shown in
Table 2.
As can be seen, users identified two acceptable
replacement parts for most targets.

3.3 Parametric Distance with Default Profile
In this experiment, we initialize the profile to its default value.
Each element of the profile is set to 5.0 and bounded to a range of
0.0 to 10.0. Given this default profile, we search for parts similar
to part 4823. The 34 parts closest to the target are shown in
Figure 2. The plot shows the 34 parts arranged vertically in 8
groups. All parts in each group are the same distance from the
target and that distance is indicated below the x-axis. The 5 parts
in the first group (shown on the left) are a distance of 0.0 from the
target. The 8 parts in the second group have a distance of 0.29 to
the target. We refer to each grouping as a cluster and note the
number of parts in each cluster. Note that since all of the parts in
any one cluster are the same distance from the target, the order in
which they are listed in Figure 2 is arbitrary.

Figure 2. Parts Similar to 4823 Using a Default Profile


In order to assess the "ranking" of a part, we need to consider
three values: the rank of the cluster in which it lies, the size of the
cluster in which it lies, and the total number of parts in all clusters
closer to the target. For example, the distance between part 4384
and the target, 4823, is 1.62. There are two parts that both have
this distance and they are considered a cluster of size two. This is
the fifth cluster and there are 15 parts closer to the target.

Highlighted in this figure are the parts that were selected by the
three users. Significantly, the default profile ranks all the user-
identified parts in one of the top 7 clusters and in the top 24 of all
4842 parts. This demonstrates the utility of using the parametric
distance function for this application.

Mixed in among the parts selected by the three users are many
other parts that are the same distance or closer to the target part.
These parts represent potential replacement parts that were not
found by the users. For example, the three parts not selected in
the first cluster appear to be drop-in replacements (with some


696

parameters possibly upgraded) and these were not found by any of
the users.

It is interesting that, for each user, the distance values of the two
selected parts are the same, yet those value differ from one user to
the next. This suggests that there is some consistency in each
user's selection process and that the parametric distance captures
this consistency.

Similar results are found for two more SRAM parts, the 4838 and
the 4839. These results are not presented here. For details, please
see [2].

There is a fourth SRAM part for which we have user data: part
4827. User 1 identified one replacement for this part and User 2
identified two as shown in Table 2.

In this case, the results of our algorithm differed significantly
from the selections of the two users. While these users identified
parts 4828, 4829, and 4839 as the best replacement parts they
could find, our algorithm with the default profile ranked these
parts 3875, 593, and 499 respectively. In other words, there are
3874 parts that are closer to the target than the part that User 1
selected (4828).

Why did the default profile perform so poorly? To examine this,
we look at the target and the part selected by User 1, side by side.
The parameters in which these two parts differ are shown in Table
3.

We see that the target part was built to military specifications or
mil spec (as indicated by the MHR and RL parameters) with
significantly less current draw (MC and MII) and lower min.
supply voltage (MSV). A casual observer (as the default profiles
represents) might not expect 4828 to be an appropriate
replacement.
In fact, the difference function for military
specifications assigns a high penalty to replacing a mil spec part
with a non-mil spec part. Thus, the algorithm correctly ranked it
low.

However, after receiving just one iteration of user feedback
indicating that this user is willing to replace mil spec parts with
non-mil spec parts, part 4828 moves up to the 3rd cluster with only
3 parts closer to the target.

3.4 Intra-Target Adaptation
For most target parts, each user has identified two potential
replacements. In this test, we select one of these replacements,
allow the profile to adapt, and then measure the improvement in
ranking of the second part compared to it's position using the
default profile. The results are shown in Table 4.

The default profile does quite well, always ranking the selected
parts one of the first 7 clusters and always with fewer than 20
parts ranked higher. When the selected part is ranked in the top
cluster, it provides no feedback for adaptation. This is the case in
6 of the 14 cases. Of the remaining 8 cases, there are 4 in which
the cluster ranking and number of parts above did not change, but
in each of those, the part was initially ranked in the 2nd or 3rd
cluster.
In four cases, the ranking of the second part was
significantly improved after feedback from the first (cluster 7 to
cluster 1 or cluster 6 to cluster 1).

3.5 Inter-Target Adaptation
Now we investigate how well adaptation based on one or two
target/selected pairs can improve the ranking of the third (for
Users 1 & 2). For the data collected, excluding the mil spec part,
there are 48 possible combinations of training pairs and test pairs.
Table 5 below, presents a randomly selected sampling of those
combinations.

For User 1, the 2-sample training set always improved the cluster
ranking of the test part. For User 2, the cluster ranking remained
unchanged. Rather than indicating a difference between the two
users, this difference may be an artifact of sparse data. Many of
these target / selection pairs do not cause a change to the profile.
We believe that with a larger training set, we would see more
adaptation and would see improvements in the cluster ranking.

3.6 Summary of Experimental Results
The use of a parametric distance measure for similarity
measurements can significantly improve the search efficiency by
finding appropriate replacement parts (as indicated by our test
users) and presenting them to a user. All replacement parts were
moved to the top ranked 21 parts (or top 0.5% of the entire
dataset) with the default profile. It can also identify potential
replacement parts that would not otherwise be found by increasing
the size of the top-ranked clusters. In other words, this approach
increases the recall of replacement parts, which gives the
application engineer more options in finding a solution that is
cost-effective.
Starting with the default profile, once a user
identifies one acceptable replacement and the profile is allowed to
adapt, other acceptable replacements move into the top three
clusters (if they were not already there). The data collected is too
sparse to conclusively prove the hypothesis that learning on one
target part can improve the results for a different target part.
However, these preliminary experiments using real user data are
encouraging.

4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have sketched the obsolete parts acquisition
process and presented a solution addressing that problem. Our
technical approach to the problem makes use of machine-learning
based techniques to profile the application requirements of
various classes of engineers, and uses those profiles to tune the
behavior of our nearest-neighbor based algorithms. We have
shown that our approach works well in a set of experiments
employing both real-world parts databases and realistic user
queries. We have developed and tested our algorithms in
collaboration with a community of actual users, who have
validated our research directions. Finally, the central benefit of
our approach is that it reduces the time required by an engineer to
locate a replacement part and also increases the likelihood that a
replacement part can be found and an expensive redesign avoided.

5. FUTURE WORK
In this work we have shown the success of our algorithms in
stand-alone experiments. The next step will consist of an
implementation of our profiling and clustering work in an actual
commercial strength research prototype. We expect to commence
that stage of our work in the near future.

In addition, we plan to explore the incorporation of other types of
learning techniques into our search algorithms. In our current
work we have employed profiling algorithms that leverage
information about the previous behavior patterns of
a given
engineer to help that same engineer complete his or her task. We
have not attempted to employ collaborative filtering techniques
(e.g. [7], [8]) that make use of information about a community of
users since in our initial prototype there was only a small group of
(relatively) dissimilar users. As a community of users develops
around our ePortal, we expect to pursue this direction in future
work.
