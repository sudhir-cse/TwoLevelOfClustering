ABSTRACT
To analyze the effect of the oceans and atmosphere on land
climate, Earth Scientists have developed climate indices,
which are time series that summarize the behavior of se-
lected regions of the Earth's oceans and atmosphere.
In
the past, Earth scientists have used observation and, more
recently, eigenvalue analysis techniques, such as principal
components analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposi-
tion (SVD), to discover climate indices. However, eigenvalue
techniques are only useful for finding a few of the strongest
signals. Furthermore, they impose a condition that all dis-
covered signals must be orthogonal to each other, making it
difficult to attach a physical interpretation to them. This
paper presents an alternative clustering-based methodology
for the discovery of climate indices that overcomes these lim-
itations and is based on clusters that represent regions with
relatively homogeneous behavior.
The centroids of these
clusters are time series that summarize the behavior of the
ocean or atmosphere in those regions. Some of these cen-
troids correspond to known climate indices and provide a
validation of our methodology; other centroids are variants
of known indices that may provide better predictive power
for some land areas; and still other indices may represent
potentially new Earth science phenomena. Finally, we show
that cluster based indices generally outperform SVD derived
indices, both in terms of area weighted correlation and direct
correlation with the known indices.

It is well known that ocean, atmosphere and land pro-
cesses are highly coupled, i.e., climate phenomena occurring
in one location can affect the climate at a far away loca-
tion. Indeed, understanding these climate teleconnections
is critical for finding the answers to questions such as how
the Earth's climate is changing and how ecosystems respond
to global environmental change. A common way to study

such teleconnections is by using climate indices [6, 7], which
distill climate variability at a regional or global scale into a
single time series. For example, the NINO 1+2 index, which
is defined as the average sea surface temperature anomaly
in a region off the coast of Peru, is a climate index that
is associated with the El Nino phenomenon, which is the
anomalous warming of the eastern tropical region of the Pa-
cific. El Nino has been linked to climate anomalies in many
parts of the world such as droughts in Australia and heavy



446

rainfall along the eastern coast of South America [18]. Fig-
ure 1 shows the correlation between the NINO 1+2 index
and land temperature anomalies, which are deviations from
the mean. Observe that this index is highly correlated to the
land temperature anomalies on the western coast of South
America, which is not surprising given the proximity of this
region to the ocean region defining the index. However, few
outside the field of Earth Science would expect that NINO
1+2 is also highly correlated to land regions that are far
away from the eastern coast of South America, e.g., Africa
and South-East Asia.
Most commonly used climate indices are based on sea level
pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) in ocean
regions. These indices can ease the discovery of relation-
ships of SST and SLP to land temperature and precipita-
tion. These variables in turn, impact plant growth, and are
therefore important for understanding the global carbon cy-
cle and the ecological dynamics of the Earth.
Because of this, Earth Scientists have devoted a consid-
erable amount of time to developing/discovering climate in-
dices, such as NINO 1+2 and the other indices described
in Table 1.
One of the approaches used to discover cli-
mate indices has been the direct observation of climate phe-
nomenon. For instance, the El Nino phenomenon was first
noticed by Peruvian fishermen centuries ago. The fishermen
observed that in some years the warm southward current,
which appeared around Christmas, would persist for an un-
usually long time, with a disastrous impact on fishing. In
the early 20th century, while studying the trade winds and
Indian monsoon, scientists noticed large scale changes in
pressure in the equatorial Pacific region which they referred
to as the `Southern Oscillation.' Scientists developed a cli-
mate index called the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) to
capture this pressure phenomenon. In the mid and late 60's,
the Southern Oscillation was conclusively tied to El Nino,
and their impact on global climate was recognized. Needless
to say, finding climate indices in this fashion is a very slow
and tedious process.
More recently, motivated by the massive amounts of new
data being produced by satellite observations, Earth Scien-
tists have been using eigenvalue analysis techniques, such as
principal components analysis (PCA) and singular value de-
composition (SVD), to discover climate indices [16]. While
eigenvalue techniques do provide a way to quickly and auto-
matically detect patterns in large amounts of data, they also
have the following limitations: (i) all discovered signals must
be orthogonal to each other, making it difficult to attach a
physical interpretation to them, and (ii) weaker signals may
be masked by stronger signals. These points are discussed
in more detail in Section 3.
This paper presents an alternative clustering-based method-
ology for the discovery of climate indices that overcomes
these limitations. The use of clustering is driven by the in-
tuition that a climate phenomenon is expected to involve a
significant region of the ocean or atmosphere, and that we
expect that such a phenomenon will be `stronger' if it in-
volves a region where the behavior is relatively uniform over
the entire area. SNN clustering [2, 3, 4] has been shown to
find such homogeneous clusters. Each of these clusters can
be characterized by a centroid, i.e., the mean of all the time
series describing the ocean points in the cluster, and thus,
these centroids represent potential climate indices. This ap-
proach offers a number of benefits: (i) discovered signals
do not need to be orthogonal to each other, (ii) signals are
more easily interpreted, (iii) weaker signals are more readily
detected, and (iv) it provides an efficient way to determine
the influence of a large set of points, e.g, all ocean points,
on another large set of points, e.g., all land points.
The results of applying our methodology to discover clus-
ter indices are encouraging. Some of the cluster centroids,
i.e., candidate indices, that we found are very highly corre-
lated to known indices. This represents a rediscovery of well-
known indices and serves to validate our approach. In fact,
we are able to rediscover most of the known major climate
indices using our approach. In addition, some of the cluster
centroids that have a high correlation to well-known indices
may represent variants to well-known indices in that, while
they may represent the same phenomena, they may be po-
tentially better predictors of land behavior for some regions
of the land. Finally, cluster centroids that have medium or
low correlation with known indices may represent potentially
new Earth science phenomena.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a
quick introduction to Earth Science data and climate in-
dices, while Section 3 provides a more detailed look at how
eigenvalue techniques are used to discover climate indices
and the limitations of this approach. Section 4 describes
our methodology and Sections 5 presents the results of ap-
plying this methodology to find climate indices that have a
strong connection to land temperature. Section 6 summa-
rizes our work and indicates future directions. Our prelimi-
nary results on this topic have appeared in several workshop
papers [17, 15, 14, 13].


2. EARTH SCIENCE DATA AND CLIMATE
INDICES
The Earth science data for our analysis consists of global
snapshots of measurement values for a number of variables
(e.g., temperature, pressure and precipitation) collected for
all land and sea surfaces (see Figure 2). These variable val-
ues are either observations from different sensors, e.g., pre-
cipitation, Sea Level Pressure (SLP), sea surface tempera-
ture (SST), or the result of model predictions, e.g., NPP
(Net Primary Production or plant growth) from the CASA
model [10], and are typically available at monthly intervals
that span a range of 10 to 50 years. For the analysis pre-
sented here, we focus on attributes measured at points (grid
cells) on latitude-longitude spherical grids of different reso-
lutions, e.g., land temperature, which is available at a reso-
lution of 0.5 ×0.5, and SST, which is available for a 1 ×1
grid, and SLP, which is available for a 2.5 × 2.5 grid.
Most of the well-known climate indices [6, 7] based upon
SST and SLP are shown in Table 1. Many of the indices rep-
resent the El Nino phenomenon and are highly correlated,
as shown in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the time series for the
NINO 1+2 index. The peaks correspond to El Nino events.
The spatial and temporal nature of Earth Science poses
a number of challenges. For instance, Earth Science time
series data is noisy, has cycles of varying lengths and reg-
ularity, and can contain long term trends.
In addition,
such data displays spatial and temporal autocorrelation, i.e.,
measured values that are close in time and space tend to be
highly correlated, or similar. To handle the issues of season-
ality (yearly cycles) and temporal autocorrelation, we pre-
process the data to remove seasonality. In particular, we use

the `monthly Z score' transformation, which takes the set of
values for a given month, calculates the mean and standard
deviation of that set of values, and then `standardizes' the
data by calculating the Z-score of each value, i.e., by sub-
tracting off the corresponding monthly mean and dividing
by the monthly standard deviation. The Z-score transfor-
mation also reduces temporal autocorrelation significantly.
Since we used time series spanning 41 years (12 monthly
measurements each year), we also detrended the data be-
fore our analysis.
For further details on these issues, we
refer the reader to [15] and [17].

3. FINDING STRONG SPATIAL OR TEM-
PORAL PATTERNS USING SVD ANAL-
YSIS
Given a data matrix, whose rows consist of time series
from various points on the globe, the objective is to dis-
cover the strong temporal or spatial patterns in the data.
Earth scientists routinely use Empirical Orthogonal Func-
tions (EOF), to find spatial patterns, and temporal patterns
[16]. EOF is just another name for a statistical technique
known as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which, in
turn, is similar to a technique from linear algebra, which
is known as singular value decomposition (SVD). (For true
equivalence, it is necessary to remove the mean from the
data before applying SVD.) At a high level, SVD decom-
poses a matrix into two sets of patterns, which, for Earth
science data, correspond to a set of spatial patterns and a
set of temporal patterns. These patterns come in pairs, i.e.,
for every temporal pattern there is a corresponding spatial
pattern. See [16] for a more technical description.
Also, for each pair of patterns, there is an associated value
(called a singular value), which is greater than or equal to
0. The strongest patterns (or the patterns that capture the
largest amount of variation in the data) are associated with
the largest singular values, and often, by looking at only the
first few singular values and their associated pairs of spatial
and temporal patterns, it is possible to account for most
of the variation in the data. Looked at another way, the
original data can be approximated as a linear combination
of these strongest patterns.
Finally, for Earth science data, we can plot the tempo-
ral patterns (right singular vectors, known as t-EOFs) in a
regular line plot and the spatial patterns (left singular vec-
tors, plain EOFs) on a spatial grid, and thus, visualize these
patterns.

An SST Example

To illustrate EOFs and t-EOFs we provide an example
using SST data.
In the following, we use data that has
been pre-processed using the monthly Z-score and detrend-
ing.
(Note that the rows of this data have a mean of 0
and thus, and SVD analysis is equivalent to an EOF analy-
sis.) Finding the top spatial and temporal patterns via SVD
is a simple matter using current mathematics or statistics
packages. For example, in MATLAB this requires only the
following command: [u s v] = svds(z sst, 30), where z sst
is the SST data matrix which has been normalized using the
monthly Z-score. The columns of u, the left singular vec-
tors, are the spatial patterns, the diagonal elements of s are
the singular values, and the columns of v, the right singular
vectors, are the temporal patterns.
For SST, the strongest temporal pattern (the first column
of v) is highly related to the El Nino climate phenomenon as
shown in Figure 3. The correlation of the first right singular
vector with NINO4 is 0.69. The spatial pattern correspond-
ing to the first column of v is the first column of u. This
pattern, shown in Figure 4, indicates the strongest areas
contributing to the pattern. While this gives some indica-
tion of the areas involved in El Nino, the pattern is not as
well localized as for the clusters used to derive candidate
indices later in the paper.

Limitations of SVD Based Approaches

The performance of SVD in the above example, is impres-
sive: a well-known climate index was discovered straightfor-
wardly. However, there are a number of limitations of SVD
analysis, most of which are well-known. For example, SVD
finds the strongest patterns best since its goal is to pro-
vide the best rank k approximation to a matrix, 1  k 
rank(data matrix) [1]. Thus, slightly weaker patterns may
not `show up' as well as the stronger patterns.
For this
reason--as well as the orthogonality constraint described
below--only the first few SVD vectors are typically regarded
as trustworthy. For example, in Earth science time series,
seasonality dominates all other patterns.
Thus, for SVD
analysis, if the seasonality is not removed from the data, at
least the first few strongest patterns will be seasonal pat-
terns of different types. Indeed, other strong patterns, such
as El Nino, emerge more clearly once seasonality is removed.
However, El Nino and other strong patterns, e.g., AO, may
in turn mask yet other patterns. Of course, clustering is
somewhat subject to the same problem--small clusters are
hard to detect--but, we would argue, not to the extent of
SVD. Indeed, as we show in Section 5, clustering approaches
can potentially find many `good' clusters that correspond to
weak, as well as strong climate patterns.
Also, the patterns found using SVD, i.e., the singular vec-
tors, are constrained to be orthogonal to each other. While
orthogonality may be appealing mathematically, it can also
make patterns hard to interpret. Researchers have devel-
oped an approach to try to address this problem--`rotated'
EOFs --but it is somewhat controversial since its applica-
tion may not provide any improvement or, in some cases,
may split a single pattern into two patterns [16].
Yet another limitation of SVD is best illustrated by ex-
ample. Suppose that we have a number of clusters in two
dimensional space, e.g., 10, then SVD cannot find all of these
`patterns' because u and v consist only of two vectors. More
generally, SVD will find patterns if they fall into independent
subspaces, but cannot distinguish between patterns that lie
within a subspace, and may have problems with patterns in
overlapping subspaces.
Finally, while efficiency can be a concern for the SVD
approach, we note that even with our biggest current data
set--consisting of
70,000 time series of length 492--SVD
computation times are still acceptable: less than 10 minutes
on a 2.8GHz Intel processor.


4. CLUSTERINGBASEDMETHODOLOGY
FOR THE DISCOVERY OF INDICES
In this section, we elaborate on two key steps for find-
ing climate indices: find candidate indices using clustering,
and then evaluate these candidate indices for Earth Science
significance.

4.1 Use clustering to find candidate climate
indices
Various techniques can be used for clustering Earth Sci-
ence data. For instance, a mixture model approach has been
used to identify the cluster structure in atmospheric pres-
sure data [12], a novel divisive clustering algorithm, ACTS
(Automatic Classification of Time Series), was used for land
use classification [20], and a modified version of a hierarchi-
cal clustering algorithm was used for land use segmentation
[19]. Furthermore, we also used the K-means [8] and DB-
SCAN [5] clustering algorithms in some of our preliminary
investigations of Earth Science data.
However, in this work, we will use our SNN clustering
approach described in [2, 3, 4]. This technique first finds
the nearest neighbors of each data point and then rede-
fines the similarity between pairs of points in terms of how
many nearest neighbors the two points share. Using this
definition of similarity, our algorithm identifies core points
and then builds clusters around the core points. The use
of a shared nearest neighbor definition of similarity allevi-
ates problems with varying densities and high dimensional-
ity, and the use of core points handles problems with shape
and size. Furthermore, the number of clusters is automat-
ically determined by the location and distribution of core
points. Another novel aspect of the SNN clustering algo-
rithm is that the resulting clusters do not contain all the
points, but rather, contain only points that come from re-
gions of relatively uniform density.
These features allow
the algorithm to find clusters that other approaches over-



449

look, i.e., clusters of low or medium density which represent
relatively uniform regions `surrounded' by non-uniform or
higher density areas. With respect to Earth Science data,
SNN clustering produces high quality clusters, which are al-
most always geographically contiguous, and automatically
selects the number of clusters. Because of space considera-
tions, we omit a detailed description of the SNN algorithm
and refer the reader to [2, 4]. Note that [4] contains experi-
mental results indicating that SNN clustering works better
than DBSCAN or K-means when the goal is to find clusters
of relatively uniform densities.

4.2 Evaluate Candidate Indices
To evaluate potential ocean climate indices, we need a nu-
merical measure of the strength of the association between
the behavior of a candidate index and land climate. Earth
Scientists have traditionally used correlation [9] to measure
the degree of association between two time series. In general,
we are only interested in using a time series (cluster centroid,
or otherwise) as an index if it shows a strong correlation--
positive or negative--with the behavior of a well-defined re-
gion of the land and if the strength of that correlation is
comparable to that of known indices.
To evaluate the influence of climate indices on land, we
use area-weighted correlation, which is the weighted average
of the correlation of the climate index with all land points,
where weight is based on the area of the land grid point.
Area-weighted correlation is computed as follows. We first
compute the correlation of the time series of the candidate
climate index with the time series associated with each land
point. We then compute the weighted average of the abso-
lute correlations of each land point, where the weight associ-
ated with each land point is just its area. (We use absolute
correlation because we are interested in the strength of the
connections between ocean/atmosphere and land, not the di-
rection.) The resulting area-weighted correlation value can
be at most 1 (this would be the case where all land time se-
ries have a correlation of 1 or -1 with the candidate index),
but is normally much lower. The minimum value of area
weighted correlation is 0.
Note that if area weighted correlation of a candidate index
is too low, it could mean that either it is not a good index,
or it impacts only a small number of land grid points.

Accounting for Lags

As mentioned earlier, since the same Earth Science phe-
nomenon can occur at different times in different places, we
want to use a form of area weighted correlation that takes
these lags into account. Thus, it is necessary to compute
the area-weighted correlation for various shifts.
This in-
volves shifting two time series to simulate leads (lags) of up
to six months, computing the correlation, and then taking
the `best' (highest positive or negative value) as the corre-
lation. This procedure is used in all of our evaluations.

A Baseline for Area Weighted Correlation

We need a baseline to compare the values of the area
weighted correlations of candidate indices. First we decided
to look at the area weighted correlation of random time se-
ries since this gives us a means of judging how spurious the
area weighted correlation of a time series might be. The
histogram of the area weighted correlation of 1000 random
time series is shown in Figure 5. We can see that no random
time series have an area weighted correlation greater than
0.09, which indicates that 0.l might be a good baseline level
to use as a threshold for deeming a candidate index worthy
of consideration.

To provide a further check as to the usefulness of this
threshold, we computed the total area-weighted correlations
for 11 well-known indices, which are shown in Figure 6. Note
that all indices, except for one, have an area weighted cor-
relation greater than 0.1. Thus, if a candidate index shows
an area-weighted correlation that is roughly 0.1 or higher,
we investigate it further.

5. DISCOVERY AND ANALYSIS OF
CLUSTER-BASED INDICES
In this section we describe the results of discovering SST
and SLP climate indices using the SNN clustering approach.

Figure 7: 107 SST clusters.



Because of space constraints, we mostly focus on SST, al-
though some SLP results are also presented. As part of this
discussion, we also compare potential climate indices derived
by an SVD approach to the cluster-based indices.

5.1 SST-based Candidate Indices
We applied SNN clustering on the SST data over the time
period from 1958 to 1998. There are 107 clusters found by
SNN, as shown in Figure 7. Note that many grid points
from the ocean do not belong to any clusters (these are the
points belonging to the white background), as these points
come from regions that are not relatively uniform and ho-
mogeneous. Since we are mainly interested in finding strong
candidate indices, we first eliminate all clusters with poor
area-weighted correlation, i.e., below the specified baseline
of 0.1. The cluster centroids of the remaining clusters are
potential candidate indices.
For further evaluation of the candidate indices, we divided
the cluster centroids into 4 groups, G0, G1, G2, and G3, de-
pending on the correlation of the cluster centroids to known
indices. Cluster centroids (G0) that are very highly corre-
lated to known indices represent a rediscovery of well-known
indices and serve to validate our approach. Cluster centroids
(G1) that have a high correlation to well-known indices rep-
resent variants of existing indices, but can be useful alterna-
tives if they are better predictors of land behavior, at least
for some regions of the land. Finally, cluster centroids (G2
and G3) with medium to low correlation may represent po-
tentially new Earth science phenomena. These four groups
of clusters are shown in Figures 8-11.

Candidate Indices Similar to Known Indices

Figure 8 shows clusters that reproduce some well-known
climate indices. In particular, we were able to replicate the
four El Nino SST-based indices: cluster 94 corresponds to
NINO 1+2, 67 to NINO 3, 78 to NINO 3.4, and 75 to NINO
4. The correlations of these clusters to their corresponding
indices are higher than 0.9, as shown in the second and third
columns of Table 3. In addition, cluster 67 is highly corre-
lated to the CTI index, which is defined over a wider area

in the same region. Clusters 58 and 59 are very similar to
the other El Nino indices, and correlate most strongly with
NINO 3 and NINO 4, respectively. But their correlations to
the El Nino indices are not as high as the other 4 clusters.

Candidate Indices that Are Variants of Known In-
dices

Although the clusters that are highly and moderately cor-
related with known indices probably capture similar Earth
science phenomena, there is still benefit to considering such
variants of known indices. In particular, some cluster cen-
troids provide better `coverage,' i.e., higher correlation, for
some areas of the land.
This is illustrated in Figure 12,
which compares the El Nino indices to that of cluster 29
(G1). Color indicates the difference in correlation. Areas
of yellow indicate where the cluster centroids have higher
correlation, while areas of blue indicate where the El Nino
indices have higher correlation.
It is clear that for these
clusters, there are areas of the land where the cluster `out-
performs' the known indices. Similar results are obtained

Candidate Indices that May Represent New Indices


The clusters that are less well correlated with known in-
dices (G2 and G3) may represent new Earth science phenom-
ena or weaker versions or variations of known phenomena.
Again, some of these cluster centroids provide better `cover-
age,' i.e., higher correlation, for some areas of the land. This
is illustrated in Figure 13, which compares the El Nino in-
dices to that of clusters 62 (G2). Once more, areas of yellow
indicate where the cluster centroids have higher correlation,
while areas of blue indicate where the El Nino indices have
higher correlation.
Observe that cluster 62 `outperforms'
the known indices for some areas of the land. In contrast,
clusters 4 and 5 in the group G3 derive most of their area
weighted correlation from the land areas located close to the
clusters. Hence, they do not appear to represent significant
teleconnections.

Comparison with SVD based Indices

To compare the performance of our cluster-based candi-
date indices with the SVD based technique, we calculated
the correlation of the first 30 SVD components of SST to
the El Nino Indices.
The area-weighted correlations are computed for the SST
cluster centroids and the SVD components of SST. The re-
sults for the clusters from G0 and G1 are shown in Figure 14.
Figure 15 shows the results for the SVD components. The
area-weighted coverage baseline 0.10 is shown as a horizon-
tal line in both figures. Many of the cluster-based candidate
indices have area weighted correlations significantly above
0.10, while only about six of the SVD components have area
weighted correlations above 0.10. Notice that the first SVD
component has the best area weighted correlation--better
even than the best of the known indices.
However, from
Table 3, it can be seen that this component correlates with
four of the El Nino indices.
(El Nino is the most dom-
inant climate phenomenon.)
Therefore, despite the large
area weighted correlation, this component appears to have
mixed the various El Nino based indices.
The correlation of both SST-based clusters and SVD com-
ponents for NAO and AO is poor. However, the pressure
cluster-based candidate indices, described in Section 5.2,
have much higher correlation to NAO and AO. For QBO,

the SVD component is better than the cluster based index,
while for WP the reverse is true. However, in both cases,
the correlation is poor.
The best correlated SVD component for each well known
index is shown in the last column of Table 3. Notice that the
candidate indices produced by clustering SST match the El
Nino-based indices much more closely than the SVD com-
ponents.
Finally, Table 4 compares the area weighted correlations
of the centroids and SVD components chosen as most highly
correlated to the known indices. As can be seen, for the El
Nino based indices, the area weighted correlations for the
cluster centroids are comparable to or better than the area
weighted correlations for the actual indices in most cases.

5.2 SLP-based Candidate Indices
Figure 16 shows the clusters we found for sea level pres-
sure (SLP) between the time period of 1958 to 1998. Since
pressure differences are important in weather and climate,
negative correlations between pairs of clusters are also im-
portant. Indeed, most of the well-known pressure-based in-
dices (Table 1) are defined as the difference of two pressure
time series. Therefore, for the SLP clusters, we generated

candidate indices by considering the difference of all pairs of
cluster centroids. Figure 17 shows the pairwise correlation
between SLP clusters. Typically, the pairs that are promis-
ing candidate indices are negatively correlated. For exam-
ple, the negatively correlated pairs shown in Figure 17 serve
as potential candidates for pressure-based climate indices.
As shown in Table 5, c13-c20 corresponds to SOI, c7-c10
corresponds to NAO, and c10-c18 corresponds to AO.
We also calculated the correlation of the first 30 SVD com-
ponents of SLP to some of the known indices. Only the sec-
ond and third components were highly correlated to these
indices.
(The first SVD component had little correlation
with known indices. It may be a mixture of other indices,
but more investigation is needed.) We show these correla-
tion results in Table 5. Notice that the candidate indices
produced by clustering SLP match the known indices more
closely, except for SVD component 2 which matches AO
more closely. However, since AO is defined as the first prin-
cipal component of the region located to the north of 20N,
it is not surprising to find that one of the SVD components
of our world-wide SLP data --the second component--is
highly correlated with the AO index.

indices, along with the cluster pairs and SVD components

that have the strongest correlations to the respective indices.
For SOI and the El Nino based indices, the area weighted
correlation of the cluster pair is significantly higher than the
area weighted correlation of the corresponding SVD compo-
nent. In fact, for SOI and NINO1+2, the cluster pairs have
higher area weighted correlations compared to their actual
indices.
For AO and NAO, area weighted correlations of
SVD based indices are higher than the cluster pairs. But
note that the same SVD component is chosen for both in-
dices, indicating a possible mixing of the time series.
Recently a new index, the Indian Ocean Dipole Mode in-
dex (DMI), has been discovered [11].
(Because the time
series for this index is shorter than other known indices,
we do not incorporate this index into our analyses above.)
This index is defined as the difference in SST anomaly be-
tween the region 5S-5N, 55E-75E and the region 0-
10S, 85E-95E, and is an indicator of a weak monsoon
over the Indian subcontinent and heavy rainfall over East
Africa. Figure 18 shows a plot of c16-c22 versus the Indian
Ocean Dipole Mode index. Note the close connection be-
tween the two time series: the correlation between them is

the index is defined using SST, c16-c22 is a pressure based
index.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper we demonstrated that clustering can pro-
vide an alternative approach to eigenvalue analyses--based
on PCA or SVD--for finding ocean climate indices. Specifi-
cally, we showed that centroids of many clusters of SST and
SLP data found using the SNN clustering algorithm cor-
respond to known climate indices and provide a validation
of our methodology; other centroids are variants of known
indices that may provide better predictive power for some
land areas; and still other indices may represent potentially
new Earth science phenomena. Indices that represent new
Earth science phenomena will require further evaluation by
domain specialists. In addition, we compared potential in-
dices derived from using SVD to our candidate indices and
to well-known indices, showing that, in general, the SVD de-
rived indices had lower area weighted correlation than many
of the cluster-derived candidate indices and the well-known
indices. This comparison showed that cluster based indices
generally outperform SVD derived indices, both in terms
of area weighted correlation and direct correlation with the
known indices.
It should be noted that SVD results were obtained by us-
ing the data for the entire ocean (SST), or for SLP, for the
entire globe. Earth scientists typically apply SVD analy-
sis to a select region. However, it requires a considerable
amount of domain knowledge to determine the appropriate
area. Clustering on the other hand, provides a means of

automatically identifying regions that may be of interest.
In the future, we plan to extend our current work to ad-
dress several unresolved issues.
Specifically, we want to
determine if there are any climate indices that cannot be
represented using clusters. Also, we have also begun to in-
vestigate the effect of eliminating any correlations whose
magnitudes are below a certain threshold. The idea is to
eliminate noise and to see if looking only at stronger corre-
lations produces better results. Finally, we intend to extend
our analyses to other land and ocean variables and to inves-
tigate ways of aggregating the data so as to make patterns
easier to detect.
