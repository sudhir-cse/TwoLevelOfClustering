ABSTRACT

Interactive visualizations are effective tools in mining scientific,
engineering, and business data to support decision-making
activities. Star Coordinates is proposed as a new multi-
dimensional visualization technique, which supports various
interactions to stimulate visual thinking in early stages of
knowledge discovery process. In Star Coordinates, coordinate
axes are arranged on a two-dimensional surface, where each axis
shares the same origin point. Each multi-dimensional data element
is represented by a point, where each attribute of the data
contributes to its location through uniform encoding. Interaction
features of Star Coordinates provide users the ability to apply
various transformations dynamically, integrate and separate
dimensions, analyze correlations of multiple dimensions, view
clusters, trends, and outliers in the distribution of data, and query
points based on data ranges. Our experience with Star Coordinates
shows that it is particularlyuseful for the discovery of hierarchical
clusters, and analysis of multiple factors providing insight in
various real datasets including telecommunications chum.

1. INTRODUCTION

Visualization techniques are powerful sense-making tools that
support knowledge workers in their decision-making activities by
stimulating visual thinking. Fayyad et al. [6] recognizes the
primary
importance
of
user
interaction
and
graphical
representations for data as part of the whole knowledge discovery
process to make patterns more understandable by users.

While most of the scientific, engineering, and business data is
multi-dimensional; i.e. datasets contain typically more than three
attributes of data, representing and making sense of multi-
dimensional data has been challenging, partially due to the three-

dimensional space we live in. The motivation for this work is to
relieve the dimensionality curse on knowledge discovery through
simple data representations that are derived from familiar and easy
to understand lower dimensional representations.

One of the goals of visualization systems is to support knowledge
workers in early stages of their data-understanding tasks. At this
stage users' purpose is to gain insight into the distribution of the
data, to explore interesting trends and clusters, and to discover
outliers. Thus, the work done is primarily qualitative not
quantitative analysis. It is assumed that once the users have a
better overall understanding of the data, they will know where to
look for numerical details for further analysis in the remaining
stages of the knowledge discovery process. Then, through
dimensionality reduction and the use of other means they can
numerically support the hypotheses they formed earlier. Thus, it is
expected that users are likely to tolerate loss of information in the
initial steps and trade insight for certainty.

Use
of simple visual representations uniform across all
dimensions is crucial in the early stages, as users need to explore
and compare a number of different options rapidly. It is too early
in the process to expect users to map data attributes to visual cues
such as color, size, direction, and position since users do not yet
have a good understanding of their data. Besides, use of multiple
encodings makes it difficult to compare trends and clusterings and
to understand data distribution in high dimensional space.

The inspiration for the present work come from Bertin's
Permutation Matrices [2], which allows users to rearrange rows
and columns to discover patterns and clusters from coarse
graphical depictions of data. In Permutation Matrices, data in each
cell are represented using simple visuals such as black or white
colored cells. Using this simple but coarse representation, it is
possible to grasp the distribution of data and clusters without the
need for exact data values. Users can tolerate loss of information
for the sake of gaining insight into the data. The strength of the
Permutation Matrices also lies in the interactivity that enables
users to integrate and separate dimensions in the visual
representation.

Another source of inspiration is Parallel Coordinates [11], which
lays out coordinates in parallel, encoding each dimension
uniformly through the same visual cue (i.e. position). In Parallel
Coordinates each data element is represented as a line passing
through the coordinate axes at the value of the element for that
dimension. While Parallel Coordinates is a very powerful

technique -especially for modeling relations- these visualizations
require user expertise and knowledge of mathematical methods.

In
summary,
desired
properties
of
a
multi-dimensional
visualization system for the early stages of exploration are:

и
Encoding all data dimensions using a single visual cue,
и
Minimal, simple visual representations of data, and
и
Interactive techniques to integrate and separate dimensions.

This paper is organized as follows. First, the basic intuition and
mathematics behind Star Coordinates is introduced, followed by
descriptions of its interaction features through the use of various
examples on a sample dataset. Next, telecommunications churn
data is used to demonstrate how Star Coordinates can be used in
the knowledge discovery process for understanding customer
patterns and distributions. Then, a short review of existing multi-
dimensional techniques is provided along with a comparison of
Star Coordinates based on the characteristics of the visual
transformation processes. The paper concludes with a sketch of
future work.


2. STAR COORDINATES

The intuition behind Star Coordinates lies in the definition of
dimension and coordinate systems. The nth dimensional space can
simply be defined as the space that is constructed through a
'sweep' of the (n-l)st dimensional space (Figure 1). While
sweeping is done through a new orthogonal direction for each
dimension in the Cartesian coordinate system, it can as well be an
angular sweep as in the cylindrical and spherical coordinate
systems. However, as Inselberg points out very appropriately
orthogonality uses up space rapidly [12] due to the fact that every
point in space is uniquely identified through projections back onto
the coordinate axes. In this work we are going to relax this
constraint a little bit to be able to build on users existing
perception of low dimensional space and extend it to higher
dimensions.

c) 3-Dlmenslonal
b) 2-Dimensional

d) 4-Dimensional


Figure 1. nth dimensional space is simply a sweep of the n-1
dimensional space.

The fundamental idea of Star Coordinates is to arrange the
coordinate axes on a two-dimensional plane, where the coordinate
axes are not necessarily orthogonal to each other (Figure 2). The
minimum data value on each dimension is mapped to the origin,
and the maximum value is mapped to the other end of the
coordinate axis. Thus, unit vectors on each coordinate axis are
calculated accordingly to allow scaling of data values to the length
of the coordinate axes.

Each point Pj basically represents an n-dimensional data element

Dj, where its location Pj (x, y) is determined by the vector sum

of all unit vectors (Ux~,Uy~)on each coordinate C i multiplied by

the value of the data element for that coordinate, as shown below:

sum of its value on each dimension.

Clearly, Star Coordinates builds on simple two- and three-
dimensional scatter plots but extends them by allowing higher
dimensional spaces to nest or overlap through non-orthogonal
coordinate axes. Overlapping however introduces ambiguities, as
the location of a point in the space no longer uniquely identifies
its values on each coordinate axis. Clearly, the location of a data
point on a 2d projection of a 3d scatter plot does not uniquely
identify its data values either. Only with the aid of interactive
dynamic transformations such as rotations and translations can
users make sense of data distribution. Star Coordinates basically
attempts to extend this idea to higher dimensions.

The approach taken is to provide interactions on the visualization
that will help users resolve ambiguities as it is done in most 3-
dimensional visualization techniques. Real datasets with large
number of data elements also decrease this ambiguity problem by
the way data is clustered naturally. Clusters, trends and outliers in
the datasets are preserved in the projected multi-dimensional
visualization and interactions help to confirm this. In the
following section such interaction techniques are described
through examples on a sample dataset.

3. INTERACTION TECHNIQUES

Current implementation of the Star Coordinates visualization
system provides a number of interaction features, which users can
utilize to gain an improved understanding of their datasets.

These features are demonstrated using an example dataset that
contains
basic
auto
specs
(e,g.
mpg,
cylinders,
weight,
acceleration, displacement, origin, horsepower, year, etc.) on
approximately 400 car makes manufactured worldwide. Figure 3
shows the initial visualization of this dataset along with the
To apply a scaling transformation users pick the end point of an
axis and pull or push with respect to the origin. When sealed the
data points are remapped according to the new sealing factor
based on the length of the axis. Sealing can be also applied on
multiple selected axes at once to examine the combined effects of
multiple dimensions and the correlations among them.

Alternatively, coordinate axes can be turned off and on effectively
setting the scaling factor to 0 and back to its previous value.

Figure 4. Scaling of the 'name' attribute from the initial layout

(Figure 3) reduces the effect of car producers on the
!:~
distribution of the data points in the visualization, thus
revealing five clusters in the dataset (e.g. A, B, C, D, and E).

specs of about 400 cars b) Histograms and c) Settings panel.

3.1 Scaling

Scaling transformation allows users to change the length of an
axis, thus increasing or decreasing the contribution of a particular
data attribute on the resultant visualization. In Figure 4, the user
scales down the 'name' attribute from the initial layout to examine
the distribution of the data points independent of the car producer.
As a consequence, five clusters emerge in the new arrangement of
the data points.

Scaling transformation is also a natural way to interact with
hierarchically expanding and collapsing clusters. In Figure 5, a
subsequent scaling of the 'origin' attribute (i.e. continent of the
car producer: America, Europe, Asia) from Figure 4 results in
merging of all the three clusters (A, B, and C) into one (N). In this
visualization points representing cars are distributed solely on the
engine specifications independent of the car producer. Thus, it
suggests that all cars produced in these two continents, (clusters A
and B) and some cars in the other continent (C) are similar with
respect to engine specs. However, the remaining continent also
produces cars of quite different specs (D and E).

larger cluster (N).

3.2 Rotation

Rotation transformation modifies the direction of the unit vector
of an axis, thus making a particular data attribute more or less
correlated with other attributes.
When multiple axes are rotated
to point in about the same direction, their contributions are
effectively aggregated in the visualization. Similarly, any other
axis pointing in the reverse direction has the opposite effect. This
way, users can easily perform a multi-factor analysis where
attributes representing desirable properties (e.g. 'horsepower',
'acceleration' and 'mpg') point in the same direction and those
attributes representing undesirable properties (e.g. weight) point
in
the
reverse
direction
(Figure
6).
As
a result,
these
transformations provide a restructuring of the data points in the
visualization based on the criteria chosen.

weight
'
displacement




Figure 6. Rotation transformation allows restructuring of the
data points based on desirable (e.g. 'horsepower',
'acceleration', and 'mpg') and undesirable factors (e.g.
'weight'). 'displacement' is made perpendicular to the other
attributes to examine its effects more explicitly.

In Figure 6, the 'displacement' attribute is rotated to be
perpendicular to the other axes. This allows users to examine the
tradeoff between 'weight'
and other three attributes (e.g.
'horsepower', 'acceleration', and 'mpg') more explicitly as it
relates to the 'displacement' of the car.

Rotation also helps considerably in resolving ambiguities in the
visualization. It allows users to separate overlapping clusters that
seem to be only one cluster.

To rotate, users pick the axis from any point on it and drag to set
the new direction to be the vector from the origin to the drag
point. Rotation transformation can also be applied on multiple
dimensions at once.


3.3 Marking

Users can mark data points by either selecting individual points or
by selecting all points within a rectangular area. Data points are
then painted with the selected color, thus making them easier to
follow in the subsequent transformations. This is useful for
examining how clusters are redistributed under new parameters as
a result of transformations. When new clusters are observed after
applying a number of transformations, having some interesting
points marked in advance is likely to help users determine the
origin or content of these clusters.

Additionally, when users move the mouse over a data point all
attribute values of that particular data element are displayed over
the visualization.


3.4 Range Selection

Users can also select data value ranges on one or more axes and
mark the corresponding data points in the visualization by the
selected color. This operation allows users to understand how
particular data value ranges are distributed in the current layout of
the data points. Once a range is selected, it can be dynamically
expanded or moved. For example, in Figure 7 the user makes an
initial range selection on the 'weight' attribute and corresponding
data points are marked with the selected green (lighter) color. As
the user moves the selection interactively, the visualization is
updated dynamically to reflect the updated range. This, in effect
allows the user to see contour regions dynamically and observe
how data points are distributed as the values of a particular
attribute change.

When
multiple selections (range or rectangle) are made
consecutively, users can choose to apply a logical operation such
AND, OR, NOT, XOR between the selection sets. These logical
operations become especially useful in slicing the data points
using specific queries (e.g. mpg > 30 AND horsepower > 130).


3.5 Histogram

Histograms are especially useful when a group of interesting data
points is identified and the user is seeking the distinguishing
features of this group of points. Histograms provide the data
distribution of all points in the dataset and of this group over each
individual attribute. Marking individual data points or groups of
points by rectangular or range selections update the histogram
view by using the selection color to indicate the selected points in
the distribution. In Figure 8, the user having identified five
interesting clusters (A, B, C, D, and E) selected each individual
duster and marked each with a different color. The histogram
view clearly indicates that cars in cluster A and B are of two
different origins and clusters C, D, and E have the same origin.
Furthermore, cars in cluster A and B have similar engine
specifications. Both clusters have ears with high mpg and low
weight. On the other hand, cars in cluster E are heaviest among all
cars. Cars in C, though from the same origin as ears in cluster E,
they too have high mpg and low weight. Cars in cluster D on the
other hand have medium range engine specs compared to cars in
C and E.




Figure 8. Histograms reveal data distributions of individually
marked clusters over a number of dimensions. Once users
discover interesting clusters of cars and mark them, histogram
views inform the user about the distinguishing origins and
engine specifications of these cars.


3.6 Footprints

When users apply transformations such as scaling and rotation
they
are
applied to
the
visualization dynamically, thus
repositioning the data points. However, occasionally it becomes
necessary to examine the path data points took to travel when a
series of consecutive transformations are applied. Footprints help
users in such situations by leaving marks of data points on the
trail for the last specified number of transformations when they
are being applied continuously.

When used in conjunction with multi-dimensional scaling and
rotation,
footprints
help
significantly in
determining
the
correlations between multiple attributes. For example, Figure 9
shows footprints on multi-dimensional scaling of 'mpg' and
'weight' attributes for the three clusters extracted. For cluster A,
although variations exist, most of the data points moved along the
axis of the
'mpg'
attribute as a result of the scaling
transformation. Thus, these points represent cars with high 'mpg'
and low 'weight'. On the other hand, most of the data points in
cluster C moved along the 'weight' attribute indicating that these
are rather heavy and low mpg cars. Finally, ears in the middle
cluster have a mix of the above specifications.

Figure 10 shows how to interpret the footprints on a two-
dimensional scaling transformation. Scaling transformation moves
points along the vector sum of the axes involved in the
transformation. Let say point P" indicates the point location
without the contribution of the dimensions x and y and let P
indicate the location when all dimensions contribute. As a result
of a two-dimensional scaling point P will move to P', thus the
direction of the movement gives an indication of the ratio of the
two attribute values and the length of the footprint gives an
indication of an aggregate (vector sum) of both attributes.

slope of the footprint indicates the ratio between the values of
the two attributes (x and y), its length indicates an aggregation
(vector sum) of both attributes.

3.7 Sticks

Star Coordinates technique integrates a number of attributes of a
data element into a single visual representation, a point. However,
there are occasions where an examination of the individual
attribute values could be useful. One way to separate a dimension
is to use a stick representation. When an attribute is mapped to a
stick, the attribute value is mapped to the length of a stick
centered at the data point in the direction of the corresponding
axis for that attribute. Multiple attributes can be mapped to sticks
as well. This way users can examine a number of dimensions at
once. In Figure 11, 'cylinders', and 'weight' attributes are mapped
to the stick's length in southward and eastward directions,
respectively. The location of the sticks is determined in the
normal way where every dimension other than 'cylinders' and
'weight' attributes contribute.

4. CHURN ANALYSIS

It is of primary importance to telecommunications companies to
understand why their customers "chum" (i.e. cancel services) in
order to identify customers that exhibit similar patterns in advance
so that new services, promotions, etc. can be offered to retain their
business. Telecommunication companies collect data from
various sources such as billing, customer service, call information,
etc. to improve their services and to retain and expand their
customer base. The 'chum' dataset that is examined here is one
such dataset, which contains information such as account length,
phone number, total day, evening, night and international
minutes, calls, and charges, voice mail and international service
plan membership, number of customer service calls, etc.

Figure 12 shows an overview of the dataset, where churned
customers are marked with a blue (dark) color and the 'chum'
attribute is turned offto remove its contribution to the location of
data points. Immediately, there appears to be two dominant
clusters of customers. Marking one of the clusters and cross
examining with the histograms (not shown in figure) reveals that
this clustering is based on the voice mail plan membership and
number of voice mail messages. An important question to ask at
this point then is whether the customers with voice mail plan
churn significantly more compared to those who don't use this
service. Scaling both of these axes reveals that this is not the case.
In both clusters there appears to be about equal percent of
churned customers.

Then, it is worthwhile to examine the significant factors that lead
to chum. At this point, it is wise to turn off some of the attributes
such as state, area code, and phone number since these attributes
are not likely to be of much interest. Also, for the sake of
simplicity, let's examine only the charge amounts (i.e. total day,
evening, night, and international charges) and turn off total
minutes and calls for day, evening, night, and international calls.
In fact, an examination by foot-printing a multi-dimensional
scaling of total day, minute, and charge attributes reveals that
there is no discrepancy between these attributes that leads to
chum, as indicated by the footprints that are parallel to each other
as in Figure 13. This is also true for evening, night, and
international
calls. In
fact,
this
clearly shows
that
the
telecommunication company in this dataset charges directly
proportional to the duration of the calls made.

Once these attributes are removed data point distribution reveals
interesting patterns (Figure 14). First of all, there appears to be
four clusters, two of them heavily populated below the other two.
This becomes more clear when the international plan attribute is
scaled as shown in Figure 15. According to this figure, clusters C
and D have a higher proportion of blue (dark) points, indicating
that customers with an international plan are more likely to chum.
Interestingly however, customers in cluster B (customers with
voice plan) are less likely to chum, a situation not observed in C
and D. Thus, only for customers without an international plan,
voice plan membership makes them less likely to chum. This may
indicate a good voice mail plan deal that makes customers more
loyal. An examination of the distribution of blue (dark) points in
cluster A reveals that the blue (dark) points tend to be denser in
the northern and southern parts of the cluster. Rotating and
scaling total day charge and number of customer service calls
accumulates the blue (dark) points in the southern part of the
cluster, thus indicating clearly that these attributes play the most
significant role in chum for customers without an international
and nor a voice mail plan (Cluster A) as shown in Figure 16.

In conclusion our analysis of the chum dataset using Star
Coordinates reveals the following findings:

1.
Customers are clustered into two main groups based on voice
mail service plan membership, but both groups exhibit
similar chum probability.
2.
Telecommunication company makes charges that are directly
proportional to the call duration, thus there is no discrepancy
between number of calls, total charge, and total minutes of a
call with regards to chum.
3.
Customers with an international plan are significantly more
likely to chum.
4.
Customers without an international plan but with voice mail
plan are less likely to churn compared to those that do not
have voice mail plan.
5.
Total day charge and number of customer service calls play
the most significant role in churn for customers without an
international plan and voice mail plan.

5. RELATED WORK

Researchers proposed a number of approaches to visualizing
multi-dimensional
datasets.
These approaches differ in their
methods to transform and map data into visual representations as
well as in the richness of interaction features. While some
approaches employ algorithmic techniques to transform/map data,
others rely more on the users' interaction to reveal interesting
patterns, clusters, trends, etc. Thus, these visualizations differ
significantly in their use in the knowledge discovery spectrum
from pure exploration to validation.

Among the pioneering work is Bertin's Permutation Matrices [2]
in which data are visualized in rows and columns of cells
containing simple graphical depictions. By rearranging rows and
columns, users try to form clusters -typically on the diagonal of
the matrix- to understand distribution of data. Chernoff's [4] use
of faces to represent multi-dimensional data is also among the
most well known work in the area. Tufte [24] also provides many
compelling
historical
examples
of
multi-dimensional
visualizations,
including the famous Jacques Pickard's 6-
dimensional visualization of the Napoleon's march to Moscow.
While Inselberg's Parallel Coordinates [12,13] uses parallel
arrangement of coordinates to accommodate multiple dimensions
on a two-dimensional surface, Worlds within Worlds [7] uses a
nested coordinate system model to visualize multi-dimensional
functions. Star plots [9] arrange coordinates axes on a circle with
equally spaced radii extending from the center of a circle and
links data points on each axis by lines to form a star. More recent
pure visualization work include Table Lens [21], VisDB [15],
Dynamic Queries [22], Visage [5] and [1,11,23,25,26]. Self-
organizing maps [16,17] on the other hand, utilize automatic
arrangement of high-dimensional data using statistical algorithms.
Other
techniques
that
couple
algorithmic
techniques
to
visualization include [3,8,18,19,20].

It is worthwhile to examine multi-dimensional
visualization
techniques in more detail since each has different pros and cons,
which make them suitable for different kinds of applications and
datasets. In order to do an effective comparison however, we need
to understand the transformation process that maps data to visual
elements in the visualization.

Visual transformation process basically takes in n data values and
maps them into k attributes (e.g. location, color, size, etc.) of a
visual element, representing a row of the n-dimensional dataset.
Effectively, there are k number of n-ary transformation functions.
Visualization techniques differ in the number of parameters of the
transformation functions as well as in the number of attributes of
the visual elements. For example, Parallel Coordinates technique
represents a row of data using n-1 connected lines passing through
n coordinates axes arranged in parallel at the corresponding
values for each dimension. Thus, there are n attributes of the
visual element representing one row of the data table and each
transformation
function takes only one parameter.
In Star
Coordinates, on the other hand, a row of data is represented by a
point (i.e. two attributes), but the transformation function takes n
parameters. Thus, we can say that while Parallel Coordinates
reveals the value at each dimension directly in the visual
representation of the data, it lacks to provide an integrated effect,
which Star Coordinates provides through a visual representation
where each dimension contributes. Besides, a point is a much
simpler and space efficient representation compared to a set of
connected lines, thus avoiding screen clutter considerably.
Besides, the complexity of the visual elements may also have a
significant impact on the understandability of a representation.
Scatterplot matrices also represent each data element as a point
but the transformation function takes only two parameters (i.e.
two attributes at a time) thus it too lacks to show an integrated
effect. Most three-dimensional visualization techniques however
do better in terms of integration since they map three attributes to
the position of the visual element and additionally map other
attributes to size, color, etc. Thus, a single visual element
integrates
a number of attributes,
however multiple visual
encodings (size, location, color, etc.) are used for a visual
element, which makes it difficult to interpret appropriately. Thus
the uniform encoding (i.e. location) in Star and Parallel
Coordinates may be better for cross-comparison and cluster
discovery tasks.

6. CONCLUSION

As Grinstein [10] points out visualization techniques harness the
perceptual
and
cognitive
capabilities
of the
users.
Star
Coordinates, as an exploratory visualization technique, aims to
excel users' such capabilities through a representation of the
higher dimensional space built on the well-known simple
representations and also through dynamic interactions that allow
users to discover trends, outliers, and clusters easily.

Current experience with Star Coordinates on a number of datasets
indicates that it is a viable approach to gain insight into multi-
dimensional data. However, in order to scale this approach to
orders of magnitude higher dimensions (>>10) coupling with
statistical data mining techniques seems inevitable. Such an
alliance could yield interesting features such as animations guided
by supervised as well as unsupervised data mining techniques.

In the broader context of knowledge discovery process providing
a history of the transformations to the user with the ability to
backtrack, or switch to alternative paths is likely to improve the
efficiency of the knowledge worker as well as highlight not only
the final result obtained but also the whole process, which is
equally important.
