ABSTRACT
In a wide range of business areas dealing with text data
streams, including CRM, knowledge management, and Web
monitoring services, it is an important issue to discover topic
trends and analyze their dynamics in real-time. Specifi-
cally we consider the following three tasks in topic trend
analysis: 1)Topic Structure Identification; identifying what
kinds of main topics exist and how important they are,
2)Topic Emergence Detection; detecting the emergence of a
new topic and recognizing how it grows, 3)Topic Characteri-
zation; identifying the characteristics for each of main topics.
For real topic analysis systems, we may require that these
three tasks be performed in an on-line fashion rather than in
a retrospective way, and be dealt with in a single framework.
This paper proposes a new topic analysis framework which
satisfies this requirement from a unifying viewpoint that a
topic structure is modeled using a finite mixture model and
that any change of a topic trend is tracked by learning the
finite mixture model dynamically. In this framework we pro-
pose the usage of a time-stamp based discounting learning
algorithm in order to realize real-time topic structure iden-
tification. This enables tracking the topic structure adap-
tively by forgetting out-of-date statistics. Further we apply
the theory of dynamic model selection to detecting changes
of main components in the finite mixture model in order
to realize topic emergence detection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework using real data collected at
a help desk to show that we are able to track dynamics of
topic trends in a timely fashion.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Problem Setting
In a wide range of business areas dealing with text streams,
including CRM, knowledge management, and Web monitor-
ing services, it is an important issue to discover topic trends
and analyze their dynamics in real-time. For example, it is
desired in the CRM area to grasp a new trend of topics in
customers' claims every day and to track a new topic as soon
as it emerges. A topic is here defined as a seminal event or
activity. Specifically we consider the following three tasks
in topic analysis:
1) Topic Structure Identification; learning a topic struc-
ture in a text stream, in other words, identifying what kinds
of main topics exist and how important they are.
2) Topic Emergence Detection; detecting the emergence of
a new topic and recognizing how rapidly it grows, similarly,
detecting the disappearance of an existing topic.
3) Topic Characterization; identifying the characteristics for
each of main topics.
For real topic analysis systems, we may require that these
three tasks be performed in an on-line fashion rather than in
a retrospective way, and be dealt with in a single framework.
The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new topic
analysis framework that satisfies the requirement as above,
and to demonstrate its effectiveness through its experimen-
tal evaluations for real data sets.
Our framework is designed from a unifying viewpoint that
a topic structure in a text stream is modeled using a finite
mixture model (a model of the form of a weighted average
of a number of probabilistic models) and that any change
of a topic trend is tracked by learning the finite mixture
model dynamically. Here each topic corresponds to a single
mixture component in the model.
All of the tasks 1)-3) are formalized in terms of a finite
mixture model as follows: As for the task 1), the topic struc-
ture is identified by statistical parameters of a finite mix-
ture model. They are learned using our original time-stamp
based discounting learning algorithm, which incrementally
and adaptively estimates statistical parameters of the model
by gradually forgetting out-of-date statistics, making use of
time-stamps of data. This makes the learning procedure
adaptive to changes of the nature of text streams.
As for the task 2), any change of a topic structure is rec-
ognized by tracking the change of main components in a
mixture model. We apply the theory of dynamic model se-
lection [7] to detecting changes of the optimal number of

main components and their organization in the finite mix-
ture model. We may recognize that a new topic has emerged
if a new mixture component is detected in the model and re-
mains for a while. Unlike conventional approaches to statis-
tical model selection under the stationary environment, dy-
namic model selection is performed under the non-stationary
one in which the optimal model may change over time. Fur-
ther note that we deal with a complicated situation where
the dimension of input data, i.e., the number of features of
a text vector, may increase as time goes by.
As for the task 3), we classify every text into the cluster
for which the posterior probability is largest, and then we
characterize each topic using feature terms characterizing
texts classified into its corresponding cluster. These feature
terms are extracted as those of highest information gain,
which are computed in real-time.
We demonstrate the validity of the topic trend analysis
framework, by showing experimental results on its applica-
tions to real domains. Specifically we emphasize that it is
really effective for discovering trends in questions at a help
desk.


1.2 Related Work
The technologies similar to 1)-3) have extensively been ex-
plored in the area of topic detection and tracking (TDT) (see
[1]). Actually 1) and 2) are closely related to the subprob-
lems in TDT called topic tracking and new event detection,
respectively. Here topic tracking is to classify texts into one
of topics specified by a user, while new event detection, for-
merly called first story detection, is to identify texts that
discuss a topic that has not already been reported in earlier
texts. The latter problem is also related to work on topic-
conditioned novelty detection by Yang et.al.[16]. In most of
related TDT works, however, topic tracking or new event
detection is conducted without identifying main topics or
a topic structure, hence the tasks 1)-3) cannot be unified
within a conventional TDT framework. Further topic time-
line analysis has not been addressed in it.
Swan and Allen [12] addressed the issue of how to auto-
matically overview timelines of a set of news stories. They
used the 2-method to identify at each time a burst of fea-
ture terms that more frequently appear than at other times.
Similar issues are addressed in the visualization commu-
nity [3]. However, all of the methods proposed there are
not designed to perform in an on-line fashion.
Kleinberg [4] proposed a formal model of "bursts of ac-
tivity" using an infinite-state automaton. This is closely
related to topic emergence detection in our framework. A
burst has a somewhat different meaning from a topic in
the sense that the former is a series of texts including a
specific feature, while the latter is a cluster of categorized
texts. Hence topic structure identification and characteriza-
tion cannot be dealt with in his model. Further note that
Kleinberg's model is not designed for real-time analysis but
for retrospective one.
Related to our statistical modeling of a topic structure,
Liu et.al. [2] and Li and Yamanishi [6] also proposed meth-
ods for topic analysis using a finite mixture model. Specif-
ically, Liu et.al. considered the problem of selecting the
optimal number of mixture components in the context of
text clustering. In their approach a single model is selected
as an optimal model under the assumption that the opti-
mal model does not change over time. Meanwhile, in our
approach, a sequence of optimal models is selected dynam-
ically under the assumption that the optimal model may
change over time.
Related to topic emergence detection, Matsunaga and Ya-
manishi [7] proposed a basic method of dynamic model se-
lection, by which one can dynamically track the change of
number of components in the mixture model. However, any
of all of these technologies cannot straightforwardly be ap-
plied to real-time topic analysis in which the dimension of
data may increase as time goes by.
Related to topic structure identification, an on-line dis-
counting learning algorithm for estimating parameters in a
finite mixture model has been proposed by Yamanishi et.
al. [14]. The main difference between our algorithm and
theirs is that the former makes use of time-stamps in order
to make the topic structure affected by a timeline of top-
ics while the latter considers only the time-order of data
ignoring their time-stamps.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
describes a basic model of topic structure. Section 3 gives
a method for topic structure identification. Section 4 gives
a method for topic emergence detection. Section 5 gives a
method for topic characterization. Section 6 gives experi-
mental results. Section 7 gives concluding remarks.


2. MODEL
We employ a probabilistic model called a finite mixture
model for the representation of topic generation in a text
stream. Let W = {w1, ··· ,wd} be the complete vocabulary
set of the document corpus after the stop-words removal
and words stemming operations. For a given document x,
let tf(wi) be the term frequency of word wi in x. Let idf(wi)
be the idf value of wi, i.e., idf(wi) = log(N/df(wi)) where
N is the total number of texts for reference and df(wi) is
the frequency of texts in which wi appears. Let tf-idf(wi)
be the tf-idf value of wi in x, i.e., tf-idf(wi) = tf(wi) ×
log(N/df(wi)). We may represent a text x of the form:

x = (tf(w1),..., tf(wd))

or

x = (tf-idf(w1),..., tf-idf(wd)).

We may use either type of the representation forms.
Let K be a given positive integer representing the num-
ber of different topics. We suppose that a text has only
one topic and a text having the i-th topic is distributed
according to the probability distribution with a density:
pi(x|i) (i = 1, 2,··· ,K), where i is a real-valued parame-
ter vector. We suppose here that x is distributed according
to a finite mixture distribution (see e.g., [8]) with K compo-
nents given by


p(x| : K) =
K
X

i=1
ip(x|i),
(1)


where i > 0 (i = 1, ··· ,K) and
PK
i=1
i = 1. We set
 = (1,··· ,K
-1
,1,··· ,K). Here i denotes the degree
to what the i-th topic is likely to appear in a text stream.
Note that each component in the mixture defines a single
cluster in the sense of soft-clustering.
Throughout this paper we suppose that each pi(x|i) takes
a form of a Gaussian density: Letting d be the dimension of

where µi is a d-dimensional real-valued vector, i is a d×d-
dimensional matrix, and we set i = (µi, i). In this case
(1) is so-called a Gaussian mixture. Note that a Gaussian
density may be replaced with any other form of probability
distributions, such as a multinomial distribution.
In terms of a finite mixture model, a topic structure is
identified by A) the number of components K (how many
topics exist), B) the weight vector (1, ··· ,K) indicating
how likely each topic appears, and C) the parameter values
i (i = 1,··· ,K) indicating how each topic is distributed. A
topic structure in a text stream must be learned in an on-line
fashion. Topic emergence detection is conducted by track-
ing the change of main components in the mixture model.
Topic characterization is conducted by classifying each text
into the component for which the posterior is largest and
then by extracting feature terms characterizing the classi-
fied texts. Topic drift may be detected by tracking changes
of a parameter value i for each topic i. These tasks will be
described in details in the sessions to follow.
The overall flow of the tasks is illustrated in Figure 1.
A text is sequentially input to the system. We prepare a
number of finite mixture models, for each of which we learn
statistical parameters using the time-stamp based learning
algorithm to perform topic identification. These tasks are
performed in parallel. On the basis of the input data and
learned models, we conduct dynamic model selection for
choosing the optimal finite mixture model. We then com-
pare the new optimal model with the last one to conduct
topic emergence detection. Finally for each component of
the optimal model, we conduct topic characterization.


3. TOPIC STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION
WITH DISCOUNTING LEARNING
In this section we propose an algorithm for learning a topic
structure, which we call an time-stamp based discounting
topic learning algorithm.
The algorithm is basically designed as a variant of the in-
cremental EM algorithm for learning a finite mixture model (see,
e.g., Neal and Hinton [9]). Our proposed one is distinguished
from existing ones with regards to the following three main
features:
1) Adaptive to the change of the topic structure. The pa-
rameters are updated by forgetting out-of-date statistics as
time goes on. This is realized by putting a larger weight to
the statistics for a more recent data.
2) Making use of time stamps for texts. Not only the time
order of texts but also their time stamps are utilized to make
the topic structure depend on the timeline. For example, for
two text data xt1,xt2 (t1 < t2), if the length t2-t1 is larger,
the topic structure learned at time t2 will be less affected by
that at time t1.
3) Normalizing data of different dimensions. We consider
the on-line situation where the dimension of a datum may
increase as time goes by. This situation actually occurs be-
cause new words may possibly be added to the list of words
every time a new text is input. Hence it is needed for nor-
malizing data of different dimensions.
We suppose that text data x1, x2,... are given in this
order, and each has a time-stamp indicating when it ap-
peared. Here is a description of the algorithm, in which 
is a discounting parameter, i denotes the posterior density
of the ith component, and m is introduced for calculation
of weights for old statistics.

where WA denotes the operation such that

WA(X,Y |A,B) =

Generally, we set the initial value (0)
i
= 1/K, m(0) = 0, a
small value to (0)

, and set µ(0)

the first xts that are different
each other. This algorithm updates i, µi, and i as the

and im(t

Note that Yamanishi et.al.'s sequentially discounting learn-
ing algorithm [14] can be thought of as a special case of this
algorithm in which the time interval tl
+1
-tl is independent
of l. In that case if we further let  = 1, the algorithm
becomes an ordinary incremental EM algorithm.
In real implementation, we supposed that i is a diagonal
matrix for the sake of computational complexity issues. The
scalability issue for dealing with a general matrix i remains
for future study.


4. TOPICEMERGENCEDETECTIONWITH
DYNAMIC MODEL SELECTION
In this section we are concerned with the issue of topic
emergence detection, i.e., tracking the emergence of a new
topic. We reduce here this issue to that of selecting the
optimal components in the mixture model dynamically. We
call this statistical issue dynamic model selection (see also
[7]).
The key idea of dynamic model selection is to first learn a
finite mixture model with a relatively large number of com-
ponents, then to select main components dynamically from
among them on the basis of Rissanen's predictive stochastic
complexity [10].
The procedure of dynamic model selection is described as
follows:

Initialization:
Let Kmax (maximum number of mixture components) and
W (window size) be given positive integers.
Set initial values of (0)
i
,(0)
i
= (µ(0)
i
,(0)
i
) (i = 1, ··· ,Kmax).

Iteration:
For t = 1, 2, ··· , do the following procedure 1 to 4:

1. Model Class Construction:
Let Gti be the window average of the posterior probability
(t
-W
i
+···+ti)/W. For k = 1, ··· ,Kmax, do the following
procedure:
Let
1
, ··· ,
k
be the indices of k highest scores such that
G(t
-1)
1
 ···  G(t
-1)
k
. Construct the following mixture
model with k components: For s = t - W,··· ,t,

where U is a uniform distribution over the domain.

2. Predictive Stochastic Complexity Calculation:

compute

S(t

(k) =

s=t-W

.

3. Model Selection:
Select kt minimizing S(t
)
(k). Let p
j
(x|(t
-1)
j
) (j = 1, ··· ,kt )
be main components at time t, which we write as {C(t
)
1
,···C(t
)
k
t
}.

4. Estimation of Parameters:
Learn a finite mixture model with Kmax components using
the time-stamp based discounting learning algorithm. Let
the estimated parameter be ((t
)
1
,··· ,(t
)
Kmax
,(t
)
1
,··· ,(t
)
Kmax
).


Note that the S(t
)
(k) can be thought of as a variant of
Rissanen's predictive stochastic complexity [10] normalized
by the dimension for each datum, which can be interpreted
as the total code length required for encoding a data stream
xt
-W
,..., xt into a binary string sequentially.
Once main components C(t
)
1
,··· ,C(t
)
k
t
are obtained, we
compare them with C(t
-1)
1
,··· ,C(t
-1)
k
t-1
to check the emer-

gence of a new topic or the disappearance of an existing
topic in the following way. If a new component is selected
at some point and remains for a longer time than a specified
threshold, we may determine that a new topic has emerged.
Specifically, if the optimal number kt of components be-
comes larger than kt
-1
, we can recognize that a new topic
has emerged. Similarly, if an existing component is not se-
lected at some time and does not appear any longer, then
we may determine that the topic has disappeared.


5. TOPICCHARACTERIZATIONWITHIN-
FORMATION GAIN
Once the optimal finite mixture model is obtained, we
are concerned with the issue of how to characterize each
topic. We address this issue by extracting terms character-
izing each topic and by observing the growth or decay of
each topic component. Details are shown below.
A) Extracting terms characterizing each topic. We at-
tempt to characterize each topic by extracting characteris-
tic words for it. We perform this task by computing the
information gain of possible words.
In the time-stamp based discounting topic learning algo-
rithm, the posterior probability distribution over the set of
clusters is estimated every time a text data is input. Ac-
cording to that posterior distribution an input text will be



814
Industry/Government Track Poster

categorized into the component for which the posterior prob-
ability is largest. This clustering task can be performed in
an on-line fashion.
After observing the t-th datum xt, for i = 1, ··· ,k, let
St(i) be the set of texts in xt = x1,..,xt classified into the
i-th component and let ti be the size of St(i). Let St =
ki
=1
St(i).
Below we show the method for computing the information
gain of a term w for each topic component. For any term
w, let S(w) be a set of vectors in St such that the frequency
of w is larger than a given threshold, and let mw be the size
of S(w). Let S( ¯
w) be a set of vectors in St such that the
frequency of w is not larger than the threshold, and m¯
w
be
the size of S( ¯
w).
For a specified topic component, say, the i-th component,
let m+
w
be the number of vectors in S(w) that are also in-
cluded in St(i). Let m+¯
w
be the number of vectors in S( ¯
w)
that are also included in St(i).
Then we define the information gain of w for the i-th topic
component as follows:

IG(w|i) = I(t,ti) -
`
I(mw,m+
w
) + I(m¯
w
,m+¯
w
)
´
,

where I(x,y) is the information measure such as stochastic
complexity [10], extended stochastic complexity [13][5]. The
stochastic complexity [10] is given as follows:

I(x,y) = xH
"y
x
"
+
1
2
log
"x
2
"
,

where H(x) = -xlog x - (1 - x)log(1 - x)log(1 - x) is the
binary entropy function, and log's base is 2. A special case
of extended stochastic complexity is given as follows [13][5]:

I(x,y) = min{y,x - y} + c
p
xlog x,

where c is a constant.
We select a specified number of terms ws of largest in-
formation gains. We can think of them the set of terms
characterizing the i-th topic component.
The statistics: mw,m+
w
,m¯
w
,m+¯
w
needed for computing
information gain can be calculated in an on-line fashion.
Hence topic characterization task is conducted in real-time.
B) Observing the growth or decay of each cluster. Let G(t
)
i
be the window average of the posterior probability of the i-
th topic component, that is, Gti = (t
-W
i
+, ··· , +ti)/W.
G(t
)
i
increases when texts corresponding to the i-th topic is
input, and decreases when the other is input. We can see
how rapidly this topic grows by observing G(t
)
i
as t goes by.

6. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We conducted an experiment on real data: contact data of
a help desk for an internal e-mail service. An example of the
data record is presented in Table 1. It has the field of contact
date/time, question/request, answered date/time, answer,
and so on. The number of the records is 1202. The date of
the first/last contact is Feb 21 2004/May 20 respectively.
We input contact dates as the time-stamps, and ques-
tions/requests as the text data to our system. We set Kmax
to 50 and  to 0.99. Our system ran on an NEC Express5800
with 1GHz Pentium III and a 1GB memory. The system was
implemented using C, and OS was Windows 2000 Server.
Processing 1202 records of data took about five minute.
Figure 2 shows the number of components kt selected by
our system as main topics . The number increases at the

beginning of March, and has a peak in the middle of April.
Since a fiscal year begins at April in Japan, we can suppose
that the number of topics at the help desk is increasing
around the first day of April.
Let us look into a few of the components, because we do
not have enough space for all of the components. Here, we
observe Component 27 and 42 in detail. Figure 3 shows the
window averages G27,G42 of the posterior probabilities and
the periods where the components are selected as main top-
ics. G27 increases in the beginning of April and has the first

peak at April 12. Then it repeats increase and decrease until
the middle of May. The corresponding component is selected
as main from the first week of April, and remains as main
until the middle of May (with short discontinuances). G42
is positive during April, and also the corresponding topic is
main during April. The lines of Gis indicate how important
the corresponding topics are in each time. Moreover, we
can observe how the emerged topics grows and disappears
from the figure. The topic corresponding to Component 42
emerges at the beginning of April, grows for two weeks, is
attenuated, then drops out from the main topics at the end
of April.
Term "transfer" was extracted as a characteristic word

for Component 27. Texts classified into this component are
questions like "Is it possible to use Service XXX after I am
transfered to YYY?". That kind of questions may increase
around the beginning of a fiscal year. "Service ZZZ" and
"failure" were extracted as chracteristic words for Compo-
nent 42. Actually, Service ZZZ failed in the beginning of
April, then, the topic consists of related complaints and
questions.
In this way we can recognize the emergence, growth, and
decay of each topic from the system. Through this example
it has turned out that our framework for topic trend analysis
are very effective for tracking dynamics of topic trends in
contact data at a help desk.

7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE STUDY
In this paper we have proposed a framework for tracking
dynamics of topic trends using a finite mixture model. In
this framework the three main tasks: topic structure identi-
fication, topic emergence detection, and topic characteriza-
tion are unified within a single framework. Topic structure
identification has been realized by our unique time-stamp
based learning algorithm. It enables tracking topic struc-
tures adaptively by forgetting out-of-date statistics. Topic
emergence detection has been realized on the basis of the
theory of dynamic model selection. It enables detecting
changes of the optimal number of components in the finite
mixture model to check whether a new topic has appeared
or not. Topic characterization has been realized by on-line
text clustering and feature extraction based on information
gain. Through the experiments using real data collected at a
help desk, it is demonstrated that our framework works well
in the sense that dynamics of topic trends can be tracked in
a timely fashion.
The following issues remain open for future study:
Context-based topic trend analysis: In this paper we have
proposed an approach to word-based topic trend analysis.
However, we need to further analyze contexts, i.e., relations
among words, in order to more deeply analyze the semantics
of topics.
Multi-topics analysis: We supposed that one text comes
from a single mixture component corresponding to a single
topic. It is our future study how to deal with texts having
multi topics.
