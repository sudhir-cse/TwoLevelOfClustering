ABSTRACT
Understanding the differences between contrasting groups
is a fundamental task in data analysis. This realization has
led to the development of a new special purpose data mining
technique, contrast-set mining. We undertook a study with
a retail collaborator to compare contrast-set mining with
existing rule-discovery techniques. To our surprise we ob-
served that straightforward application of an existing com-
mercial rule-discovery system, Magnum Opus, could suc-
cessfully perform the contrast-set-mining task. This led to
the realization that contrast-set mining is a special case of
the more general rule-discovery task. We present the results
of our study together with a proof of this conclusion.

1. INTRODUCTION
Contrast-set mining is a new data mining technique de-
signed specifically to identify differences between contrasting
groups from observational multivariate data [8, 2]. This pa-
per reports on a project undertaken to evaluate how contrast-
set mining differs from pre-existing forms of rule-discovery
in an applied context. Working with the marketing group
in one of Australia's largest discount department store com-
panies, we undertook a contrast mining project to which
we applied three alternative data mining techniques, with
unexpected and surprising results.
The project involved contrasting the pattern of retail ac-
tivity on two different days selected to highlight the effect of
specific marketing promotions on purchasing behavior. We

were provided with transaction data from the two days. The
data consisted of all items purchased in six selected stores,
each item associated with a transaction ID allowing it to be
related to other items bought by the same customer at the
same time. Due to the nature of the comparison that was de-
sired, this data was aggregated up the product hierarchy to
the department level, resulting in a total of 99 `items,' each
representing the purchase of one or more products from a
specific department. The data mining task was to identify
how the `baskets' of departments differed between the days.
The three systems studied were STUCCO [2], Magnum
Opus [15], and C4.5rules [10]. STUCCO was selected be-
cause it represents the contrast sets technique: the only data
mining approach of which we are aware that is specifically
designed for identifying contrasts between groups. Magnum
Opus and C4.5rules were selected as representatives of al-
ternative data mining approaches that have previously been
claimed [2] to be unsuited to performing the type of contrast
analysis for which contrast sets were designed.
Magnum Opus is a general purpose rule-discovery system.
It implements the OPUS AR rule-discovery algorithm [14].
It provides association-rule-like functionality, but does not
use the frequent-itemset strategy [1] and hence does not re-
quire the specification of a minimum-support constraint.
C4.5rules derives classification rules by first learning a de-
cision tree and then transforming that tree into a rule for-
mat. It and the other two systems are described in more
detail in Section 2.
To evaluate the suitability of the three techniques we
first applied each to the data and compared the models
that were produced. This is described in Section 3. As
expected, C4.5rules developed very different models to the
other two systems. To our surprise, however, Magnum Opus
found rules corresponding to all contrast sets discovered by
STUCCO, and more besides. This violated our prior expec-
tation that the special purpose contrast discovery process of
STUCCO would be better suited to the contrast discovery
task than the more general rule-discovery process of Mag-
num Opus.
Part of the claim in support of the contrast set approach
is that it incorporates selection mechanisms that prevent ir-
relevant differences from being included in the selected con-
trast sets. To evaluate this aspect of the technique we had
two marketing managers from the retailer assess all rules
produced by STUCCO and Magnum Opus. The details of
this comparison are provided in Section 4 and conclusions
presented in the final section.

2. THETHREETECHNIQUESANDTHEIR
APPLICATION
We first describe the three systems and then discuss how
they were applied to the data.

2.1 STUCCO
STUCCO is designed to be applied to grouped categorical
attribute-value data. The following description is based on
that of Bay and Pazzani [2], with some notational differences
introduced for ease of comparison between algorithms.
The data is a set of groups G1,G2 ...Gl. Each group is
a collection of objects O1 ...On. Each object Oi is a set
of k attribute-value pairs, one for each of the attributes
A1 ...Ak. Attribute Aj has values drawn from the set
Vj
1
...Vjm.
A contrast set is a set of attribute-value pairs with no
attribute Ai occurring more than once. This is equivalent
to an itemset in association-rule discovery when applied to
attribute-value data. Similar to an itemset, we measure the
support of a contrast set. However, support is defined with
respect to each group. The support of a contrast set cset
with respect to a group Gi is the proportion of the objects
o  Gi such that cset  o, and is denoted supp(cset,Gi).
Contrast set discovery seeks to find all contrast sets whose
support differs meaningfully across groups. This is defined
as seeking all contrasts sets cset that satisfy both

ijP(cset|Gi) = P(cset|Gj)
(1)

and

max
ij
|supp(cset,Gi) - supp(cset,Gj)|  
(2)

where  is a user-defined threshold called the minimum
support-difference. Contrast sets for which Eq. 1 is statis-
tically supported are called significant and those for which
Eq. 2 is satisfied are called large. Note that these are differ-
ent expressions of the same core principle, that the frequency
of the contrast set must differ meaningfully across groups.
Eq. 1 provides the basis of a statistical test of `meaningful,'
while Eq. 2 provides a quantitative test thereof. While Bay
and Pazzani define contrast set discovery in these terms, we
take the core objective of contrast discovery to be to find
contrast sets that satisfy Eq. 1 in a manner that is meaning-
ful to the individual or organization that has commissioned
the analysis. The concepts of `significant' and `large' con-
trasts are simply mechanisms that are intended to identify
such meaningful contrasts.
STUCCO employs an efficient search through the space of
contrast sets using an algorithm based on Bayardo's Max-
Miner [4] rule-discovery algorithm. The statistical signifi-
cance of Eq. 1 is assessed using a chi-square test to assess
the null hypothesis that contrast set support is independent
of group membership. A correction for multiple compar-
isons is applied that systematically lowers the value of  as
the size of the contrast sets increases. This mechanism con-
trols the probability of type-one error (incorrectly accepting
that a contrast exists). At each level i of the search (level
i explores contrast sets containing i attribute-value pairs) a
corrected significance level i is set

i = min(

2i /
|Ci|,i
-1
)
(3)

where  is the initial significance level (0.05) and |Ci| is the
number of candidate contrast sets at level i of the search.
Further pruning is employed to remove contrast sets that,
while significant and large, derive those properties only due
to being specializations of more general contrast sets that
also have those properties. For this reason any specialization
is pruned that has similar support to its parent or that fails
a chi-square test of independence with respect to its parent.
Finally, the search space below a contrast set cset is pruned
if the support for the group with the highest support remains
highest no matter what additional terms are added to cset.
Precise details of these complex pruning mechanisms are
provided by Bay and Pazzani [2].
Contrast sets are justified as a distinct data mining tech-
nique on the grounds that other existing techniques cannot
perform the same analysis. Classification learning, such as
decision trees or decision rules, appear unlikely to find all
meaningful contrasts. A classification learner finds a single
model that maximizes the separation of multiple groups, not
all interesting models as contrast discovery seeks. However,
it might be that classification learning finds the most inter-
esting set of contrasts. We seek to test this possibility in
our study, below.
Bay and Pazzani [2] argue that association rules are also
incapable of finding contrasts, even when the group is en-
coded as an explicit variable, because

[association rule discovery will not] return group
differences, and the results will be difficult to in-
terpret. [With reference to an example.] First,
there are too many rules to compare. Second,
the results are difficult to interpret because the
rule learner does not enforce consistent contrast
[7] (i.e., using the same attributes to separate
groups.) ... Finally, even with matched rules,
we still need a proper statistical comparison to
see if differences in support and confidence are
significant.

We initially accepted this argument and expected our study
to provide support therefore. We were surprised when it be-
came apparent that straightforward application of the com-
mercial rule-discovery system Magnum Opus could indeed
find group differences of a form that were straightforward
to interpret. Admittedly, however, Magnum Opus is not
a standard association-rule-discovery system. In order to
explain how it is capable of performing this task we next
provide a summary of its relevant capabilities.

2.2 Magnum Opus
Magnum Opus is a commercial implementation of the
OPUS AR [14] rule-discovery algorithm. OPUS AR extends
the OPUS [13] search algorithm to support search for rules
of the form antecedent  consequent where the antecedent
is a set (or conjunction) of attribute-value pairs and the
consequent can be any one of a set of allowed attribute-
value pairs. This differs from OPUS and other similar rule-
discovery algorithms such as Max-Miner [4] that require that
the consequent be limited to a single target attribute-value
pair. However, it turns out that the ability to consider mul-
tiple attributes in the role of the consequent is not required
for the contrast discovery task and that a rule discovery sys-
tem based on the OPUS or Max-Miner architectures would
suffice. To apply Magnum Opus to the contrast discovery
task we restricted it to considering for the consequent the
values of an attribute representing group membership.


257

OPUS performs efficient search through the space of possi-
ble rules for a single consequent by systematically exploring
the space of possible sets of attribute-value pairs that might
form an antecedent. At the time of its development, OPUS
improved upon previous systematic rule search algorithms
[6, 9, 11, 12] by

· supporting the propagation of pruning between the
children of a node by representing the view of a node
as an explicit set that may be manipulated, and

· introducing the technique of dynamic reordering of the
search-space in order to improve search efficiency.

Both of these innovations were independently rediscovered
by Bayardo [4] and incorporated in Max-Miner.
Magnum Opus utilizes the OPUS systematic search ap-
proach to perform association-rule-like search. However, it
differs from conventional association-rule discovery by not
employing the frequent-itemset strategy. Hence, it does not
require that constraints be placed on the minimum support
for a rule. Instead, it requires that a measure of rule value
or interest be specified along with the maximum number of
rules, maxr to be returned. It returns the maxr rules that
optimize the specified measure of rule value and satisfy other
user-specified constraints. Search efficiency is obtained by
pruning sections of the search space that cannot contain
one of the target rules. The system does not require that
the measure of rule value be monotonic, although pruning
is often more efficient with respect to monotonic measures.
The measures of rule value that Magnum Opus imple-
ments are support, confidence (called strength within the
system), lift, coverage, and leverage. Coverage is the sup-
port of the antecedent. If the consequent of a rule is a value
of a variable identifying a group, then the antecedent might
be considered to be a contrast set, in which case the coverage
will be the support of that contrast set for the group identi-
fied by the consequent. However, the measure on which we
will concentrate is leverage, as that is the default measure
used in Magnum Opus and the measure used in our study.
Most measures of rule interest are based on the degree to
which the observed joint frequency of the antecedent and
consequent differ from the joint frequency that would be
expected if the antecedent and consequent were independent
of each other. Leverage measures the magnitude of this
difference

leverage(a  c) = supp(a{c})-supp(a)×supp({c}) (4)

where supp(x) is the proportion of objects in the data that
contain x. Leverage is a useful measure for many rule dis-
covery tasks as it identifies the inter-relationships between
antecedents and consequents that represent large increases
in the number of individuals involved over that expected if
there were no such inter-relationship. Thus, for example,
if the consequent represents high-profit customers then the
rule with the greatest leverage will represent the sub-group
of the customer base that contains the most high-profit cus-
tomers in excess of those that would be expected in a random
sub-group of the same size.
Magnum Opus provides numerous facilities for controlling
the set of rules that are discovered. In this project, however,
other than the specification that the consequent must be a
value specifying group membership, it was employed with
default settings only. Of those, the measure relevant to the
outcome of this research is the rule filter facility. This allows
certain types of rules that are unlikely to be of interest to
be pruned during the search process.
The default rule filter seeks to prune all rules r for which
the confidence is not significantly different to the confidence
of a generalization of r. To express this in a similar form to
Eq. 1, it seeks to prune rules a  c that do not satisfy

xaP(c|a) > P(c|x).
(5)

Due to the computational requirements of strictly enforc-
ing this constraint, Magnum Opus, employs a heuristic ap-
proach that does not guarantee its universal application.
However, the heuristic does guarantee the enforcement of

P(c|a) > P(c)
(6)

and

xa  (x  c)  result,P(c|a) > P(c|x)
(7)

where result is the set of rules returned at the end of the
search. In other words, it is guaranteed that the confidence
of a rule a  c in the set presented to the user will differ
significantly both from the confidence of   c and from the
confidence of any generalization of a  c that is presented to
the user. Note that Eq. 6 is strictly equivalent to requiring
that lift be greater than 1.0, a constraint frequently enforced
by association-rule-discovery systems.
Whereas STUCCO uses a chi-square test of significance
when assessing Eq. 1, Magnum Opus uses a binomial sign
test when assessing Eq. 5, 6, and 7. Unlike STUCCO, Mag-
num Opus does not correct for multiple comparisons. The
reason for this apparent omission is that corrections for mul-
tiple comparisons maintain the experiment-wise risk of type-
one error but massively increase the risk of type-two error.
The philosophy enshrined in Magnum Opus is that data
mining is by its nature statistically unsound and that any
`knowledge' mined should be independently verified exter-
nally to the data mining process. The use of a statistical
test in Magnum Opus is regarded as a useful heuristic rather
than a guarantee of statistical soundness.

2.3 C4.5rules
C4.5rules [10] discovers classification rules by first discov-
ering a decision tree, then converting that tree to an equiva-
lent set of rules, then simplifying those rules. As this system
is one of the best known in machine learning and the finer
details of how it operates do not appear relevant to our
study, we will not seek to describe it here in detail.
The aim of classification-rule discovery is quite different
to that of either contrast-set discovery or association-rule
discovery. Whereas the later both seek to find all sets or
rules that satisfy some set of constraints with respect to
the data, classical classification-rule discovery seeks to find
a small set of rules that are sufficient to allow class predic-
tion. While such rules might be the most predictive, they
may not include all rules that are most interesting to a user.
Nonetheless, in our experience, classification-rule discovery
is often employed in real-world data mining applications in
which the objective is to find interesting rather than predic-
tive rules.
The natural way in which to apply classification-rule dis-
covery to the contrast-discovery task would appear to be to
encode the groups as a class variable and then to learn rules
to distinguish the groups. This might be expected to result

in a set of rules that concisely capture key characteristics
that distinguish the groups. This is how Bay and Pazzani
[2] suggest it should be used and is how we employed it in
this study.
Aside from the manner in which C4.5rules creates a small
set of discriminating rules, the rules created differ in a fur-
ther interesting manner from the style of contrast sets or
of the rules formed by Magnum Opus. We have config-
ured STUCCO and Magnum Opus to produce contrast sets
and rules that contain only elements of the form dept = 1,
each representing that items from the department were pur-
chased in a transaction. However, it is not possible to re-
strict C4.5rules in this way and hence C4.5rules' antecedents
can also contain elements of the form dept = 0, which in the
context of the current project amounts to a negative condi-
tion, that no products were purchased from a department.
One of the issues that we sought to assess in our study was
whether such negative conditions might be desirable in the
marketing context.


2.4 Applying the systems to the data
As described in the introduction, the data was market-
basket data representing all the transactions at 6 stores on
two distinct days, aggregated to the department level. Each
transaction was represented by the set of departments from
which purchases were made. The task was to contrast the
purchasing behavior of customers on the two days.
Table 1 provides simple high-level descriptive statistics
that support the retailers' expectation that there should be
differences in purchasing behavior. The second day has more
transactions, and each transaction on average contains items
from a greater number of departments. While the top two
departments are the same for both days, the third top de-
partment on each day does not appear in the top ten de-
partments on the other day.
Both STUCCO and C4.5rules require that data be for-
matted in a tabular attribute-value format. We processed
the data into this format, representing each transaction as
a single case with 99 binary attributes, one per department,
with the value 1 representing one or more purchases from
the department and 0 representing no purchases from that
department. In order to prevent contrast sets that contained
negative elements, STUCCO was configured to ignore 0 val-
ues. Due to the way C4.5rules treats missing values, this
was not an option for C4.5rules. For STUCCO, each day's

data was stored in a separate file. For C4.5rules, all data
was stored in a single file and an additional binary attribute
was added to distinguish the days. This additional attribute
was treated as the class attribute.
STUCCO and C4.5rules were both applied with default
settings. For STUCCO these included the significance level
0.05 and the minimum support-difference 0.01.
Magnum Opus accepts data in transaction format. To en-
able the required group comparison to be performed, each
transaction was augmented with an additional `item' repre-
senting the day on which the transaction occurred. Magnum
Opus was applied to this data with default settings aug-
mented by a single constraint that the consequents of the
rules were restricted to the values representing the two days.
Note that the default settings seek the 1000 rules that max-
imize leverage within those that satisfy the constraint that
every rule must have significantly higher confidence than its
generalizations.


3. COMPARISON OF RULES PRODUCED
STUCCO produced 19 contrast sets, Magnum Opus pro-
duced 83 rules, and C4.5rules produced 24 rules. All of
STUCCO's contrast sets contained a single value. The first
set is reproduced in Table 2. The first line lists that con-
trast set. The first two values on the second line represent
the number of transactions that contained the department
220 on each day. The next two values show the proportion
of the transactions for the day that this value represents.
The remaining lines list the results of the chi-square test of
significance.
That Magnum Opus only produced 83 rules demonstrates
that only 83 rules satisfied the constraint that every rule
must have significantly higher confidence than its general-
izations. In consequence, the same rules would have been
produced irrespective of which of the six measures of rule

value the system was requested to maximize. The use of
leverage has not been significant to the outcomes of this
study.
Magnum Opus produced 56 rules containing a single value
in the antecedent, 23 containing two values, and four con-
taining three values. All values in the two and three con-
dition rules were also represented in a one condition rule.
Some example rules are reproduced in Table 3. The val-
ues in brackets after each rule represent the values of the
named measures of rule quality and interest. The coverage
is the proportion of transactions over the two days that in-
cluded purchases from the set of departments listed in the
antecedent. The support is the proportion of all transac-
tions that included the departments and were on the day
specified by the consequent. The value in brackets following
each of these measures is the number of transactions that
the respective value represents. Note how the more specific
rules (containing more conditions) have higher confidence
(called strength by Magnum Opus) than the more general
rules containing the same conditions. This is guaranteed by
the rule filter that is applied. Note also that the dates have
been changed here and throughout the paper in order to
maintain commercial confidentiality.
The first three rules show the typical relationship between
two more general rules and a more specific rule containing
multiple departments. The first two rules indicate that the
proportion of customers buying from each of departments
851 and 855 on the second day was higher than the first.
The third rule indicates that this effect was heightened when
customers that bought from both departments in a single
transaction were considered. The next three rules are par-
ticularly interesting. Whereas items for departments 220
and 355 were each purchased more frequently on August 14
than August 21, a greater proportion of customers bought
items from both departments on the 21st than the 14th.

C4.5rules produced 24 rules. Five rules contained one
condition, two rules contained two conditions, three rules
contained three conditions, and the remaining rules were
of a variety of sizes up to 51 conditions. Table 4 repro-
duces a single-condition rule, a nine-condition rule and a
13-condition rule. The value in brackets represents the confi-
dence of the rule. Note the negative conditions in the longer
rules. All but two rules contained just one positive condition
(dept = 1) with the remaining conditions all being negative
(dept = 0). The remaining two rules were the longest rules
and contained solely negative conditions. All but one of
the rules with one positive condition corresponded to a rule
found by Magnum Opus. The one exception is rule 16, the
last rule displayed in Table 4.
Table 5 provides a high level summary of the inter-
relationships between the various rules. Each row corre-
sponds to a rule with a single-department antecedent dis-
covered by Magnum Opus. Each department has been given
a unique identifier, which is listed in the first column. Each
rule or contrast set produced by each system has been num-
bered using the order in which they were listed by the sys-
tem. The second column presents the rule number of the
single-department rule produced by Magnum Opus that con-
tains the department specified in the first column. The third
column lists any multiple-department rules that refer to that
department. The STUCCO column lists the label of the con-
trast set that contains the department, if any. If a C4.5rules

rule contains a condition specifying the inclusion of the de-
partment to which a row relates, the label for that rule is
displayed in the C4.5rules column. Hence rule 5 appears in
the row for department 345. The final column provides the
p value produced by a chi-square test of independence be-
tween the department and the group variable. This provides
an indication of whether an apparent correlation between
a department and date is merely a random happenchance.
The table is sorted on this column.

3.1 The relationship between STUCCO and
Magnum Opus
The first striking observation that we made was that Mag-
num Opus had produced rules corresponding to all contrast
sets found by STUCCO. This violated our expectations, as
we had presumed that the two systems were engaging in
quite different forms of analysis. This led us to re-evaluate
this presumption and eventually to the realization that their
core activities are equivalent.
STUCCO seeks contrast sets that satisfy Eq. 11. If the
antecedents are treated as contrast sets and the consequents
as groups, from Eq. 6 it follows that Magnum Opus seeks
contrasts sets cset that satisfy

iP(Gi |cset) > P(Gi).
(8)

In a traditional association-rule-discovery framework Eq. 8
equates to finding associations between contrast sets and
groups such that lift > 1.0, a constraint that is frequently
applied. At first sight Eq. 1 appears very different to Eq. 8.
However, as the following theorem and proof demonstrate,
they are equivalent. Thus, contrast set discovery and general
rule discovery constrained to use only the group identifier
as a consequent both seek to identify equivalent situations.
They differ only in how they assess whether a group differ-
ence is meaningful.
THEOREM. If all csets belong to a group (
l
i=1
P(Gi) =
1.0) and no group is empty (i : 1  i  l,0.0 < P(Gi) 
1.0) then

iP(Gi |cset)>P(Gi)  ij P(cset|Gi)=P(cset|Gj) (9)


Proof. From the definition of conditional probability it
follows that

iP(Gi |cset) > P(Gi)
(10)

 i
P(Gi  cset)
P(cset)
> P(Gi)
(11)

 iP(Gi  cset) > P(Gi) × P(cset)
(12)

 i
P(Gi  cset)
P(Gi)
> P(cset).
(13)

From the definition of conditional probability we obtain

 iP(cset|Gi) > P(cset).
(14)

To provide a formal derivation of the next step re-
quires a long proof by contradiction.
Due to space
constraints we provide here only an outline of that
proof.
We start with the identity P(cset)
=
l
i=1
P(Gi)P(cset|Gi). In consequence, the term P(cset)

1
We take the statistical test applied to Eq. 1 and the quanti-
tative test of Eq. 2 to be different ways of assessing whether
a difference as per Eq. 1 is likely to be meaningful.
can be considered a weighted average with non-zero weights
of P(cset|G1),P(cset|G2),...P(cset|Gl). As a result of
this, Eq. 14 entails that there is a P(cset|Gi) that is greater
than the weighted average over all groups. As it is im-
possible for all P(cset|Gi) to be greater than their cumu-
lative weighted average, it follows that ij P(cset|Gi) >
P(cset|Gj). This in turn entails Eq. 15 (with possible re-
versal of the roles of i and j). In the converse, if a set of val-
ues are not all identical, any weighted average with non-zero
weights of the values in that set must be less than the maxi-
mum value in the set. As P(cset) equals such a weighted av-
erage of P(cset|G1),P(cset|G2),...P(cset|Gl) it follows
that Eq. 15 entails maxi
=1...l
(P(cset|Gi)) > P(cset). This
in turn entails Eq. 14. As we have established that Eq. 15
and Eq. 14 each entail the other, we can conclude

 ij P(cset|Gi) = P(cset|Gj).
(15)



The main respect in which the two systems differ from
each other, then, is in the application of filters that seek to
identify and remove spurious contrast sets. Magnum Opus
uses a binomial sign test and STUCCO uses a chi-square
test. We believe that the chi-square test is a better test for
the contrast-discovery task, because it is more sensitive to
a small range of extreme forms of contrast. However, we
do not believe that this will be a practical consideration in
most contrast discovery tasks and certainly was not a practi-
cal issue in the current project. Rather, we believe that the
most important difference between the filters that the two
systems apply is STUCCO's use of a correction for multiple
comparisons and the enforcement of a minimum difference.
As discussed above, Magnum Opus does not apply such a
correction so as to avoid increasing type-two error. Also,
STUCCO applies a constraint on the minimum magnitude
of the difference between groups whereas Magnum Opus by
default does not. In consequence, Magnum Opus' filter is
much more lenient than STUCCO's, resulting in the ob-
served difference that Magnum Opus finds many more rules
than STUCCO. This leads to the question of which strategy
is best. We seek to explore this issue in the context of the
current project in Section 4.
The main respect in which the two systems differ from
traditional association-rule-discovery are in the application
of a statistical test to filter out uninteresting rules rather
than a minimum-support constraint and in the restriction
of the consequent to the group identifier. To assess the im-
portance of the first of these differences we applied Christian
Borgelt's [5] implementation of Apriori to the data. We used
the built-in mechanism of the system to restrict the conse-
quent of a rule to a day identifier. By setting the minimum
confidence to 0.0 and the minimum support and lift to ap-
propriate values it was possible to obtain a variety of differ-
ent collections of rules (ranging from 46 to 27,254 rules in
total). There was no obvious way, however, to configure the
system to filter the most useful rules for this application.
Our assessment, which admittedly could not be considered
independent, is that the type of filtering by statistical sig-
nificance advocated by Bay and Pazzani [3] is important in
this application.


4. AN ASSESSMENT OF RULE QUALITY
An analysis of the rules produced by Magnum Opus and


262

STUCCO provides examples of both cases that in our es-
timation justify STUCCO's application of a stricter filter
and those that justify Magnum Opus' application of a less
stringent filter.
Consider from the rules produced by Magnum Opus that
are listed in Section 3 the following:

220 & 290 & 60 -> August-21st [Coverage=0.000 (5);
Support=0.000 (5); Strength=1.000; Lift=1.91;
Leverage=0.0002 (2)]

This represents an example that might justify the more
stringent filter that STUCCO applies. It has very low cov-
erage but very high confidence (strength) and lift. Our as-
sessment is that there is a very high likelihood that this rule
is spurious.
On the other hand, the following rule strikes us as an
excellent example of the potential value of Magnum Opus'
more lenient criteria.

220 & 355 -> August-21st [Coverage=0.001 (15);
Support=0.001 (13); Strength=0.867; Lift=1.66;
Leverage=0.0004 (5)]

This rule identifies two departments that appear together
on the second day far more often than on the first. If this
is indeed a genuine effect, it is surprising because each de-
partment appears without the other much more frequently
on the first day than the second. It is true that the number
of cases involved is low and that there is a risk that this
rule represents a spurious correlation, but that risk must be
traded against the degree of surprisingness of the rule and
hence its potential value if it is not spurious. The probability
of the observed frequencies or more extreme being observed
if there were no relationship between the antecedent and the
consequent is 0.0044 (assessed using a two-tailed binomial
sign test). Our belief is that if there is a business case for
the exploration of this rule, it would be worth further inves-
tigation, which should, of course, include evaluation of the
likelihood that it is spurious.

4.1 Comparing STUCCO's and Magnum
Opus' contrasts
To evaluate whether the more stringent filter applied by
STUCCO is warranted we returned to our retail collabo-
rators and sought an assessment of each contrast set that
STUCCO and Magnum Opus had identified. As the raw
output of neither system is very suited for presentation of
group differences to a retail marketing manager, we devel-
oped a simple automated filter that translated the rules into
a more suitable format. Table 6 displays examples of a con-
trast in this format. Note that these example contrasts are
entirely fictitious and that the department names have been
changed here and throughout the paper in order to maintain
commercial confidentiality.
As all STUCCO contrast sets were represented by Mag-
num Opus rules, we presented only the Magnum Opus rules,
in this format, in the order produced by Magnum Opus.
Thus, the contrasts discovered by STUCCO were in no way
distinguished from those not discovered, and were inter-
mixed in the order in which they were presented. Due to
the need to gain assessments of a large number of rules and
our reluctance to impose unduly upon our voluntary collab-
orators, we asked only for a simple true/false assessment of
the following two questions with respect to each rule.
Table 6: Three contrasts as presented to the users

On August 21st customers were 7.6 times more
likely to purchase items from department 445
(MENSWEAR; Mens Nightwear) than they were
on August 14th.
They were bought in 2.2%
of transactions on August 21st and 0.3% of
transactions on August 14th.

On August 14th customers were 6.3 times more
likely to purchase items from department 855
(Girls Toys) and 851 (Boys Toys) than they
were on August 21st.
They were bought in 1.5%
of transactions on August 14th and 0.2% of
transactions on August 21st.

On August 21st customers were 2.6 times more
likely to purchase items from department
805 (Books) and 957 (Stationery) and 929
(Confectionery) than they were on August 14th.
They were bought in 0.2% of transactions on August
21st and 0.1% of transactions on August 14th.


Q 1. Is this rule surprising?

Q 2. Is this rule potentially useful to the organization?

Table 7 summarises the results of this investigation. We
list the number of contrasts that were assessed as each sur-
prising and potentially useful of those discovered by each
system. As STUCCO's filter penalises contrasts contain-
ing more elements, it is interesting to see whether the rules
containing more departments that Magnum Opus found are
assessed as less surprising or less potentially useful. For this
reason, the table first presents the rules discovered by Mag-
num Opus grouped by the number of departments in the
contrast, and then aggregated results for all rules. As pre-
viously discussed, all STUCCO contrasts contained only a
single department.
To our surprise, despite the greater selectiveness of the fil-
ter that it applies, a much lower proportion of the rules dis-
covered by STUCCO were considered surprising by the retail
experts. One possible explanation for this is that some of
the Magnum Opus contrasts are actually spurious and hence
are considered surprising because they do not actually have
any basis in fact. To assess this possibility we performed chi-
square tests of independence on all the contrasts and then a
one-tailed homoscedastic t-test of the resulting probabilities
of the surprising and the unsurprising rules. This test failed
to find a significant difference in the chi-square probabilities
of the two groups (t = 0.3788,p = 0.3097). To illustrate
this apparent lack of inter-relationship between the proba-
bility that the antecedent and consequent are independent
and the assessments of surprisingness, Figure 1 plots the
chi-square test probabilities for each of the rules, with those
rules identified as surprising distinguished from those that
are not. Note that the x-axis is ordered by Magnum Opus'
output order, from highest to lowest leverage, an ordering
correlated with chi-square test probabilities.
The proportion of contrasts assessed as potentially useful
are very similar between Magnum Opus and STUCCO. A
chi-square test of independence indicates that the difference
is not significant at the 0.05 level (2 = 0.0134, df=1, p =

Considering the Magnum Opus rules with differing num-
bers of departments, the proportion drops slightly for the
two department and three department contrasts. However,
a chi-square test of independence indicates that this vari-
ation in proportions is not significant (2 = 0.2199, df=2,
p = 0.896).


4.2 An assessment of negative conditions
As noted above, our assessment from comparing the three
systems' outputs was that C4.5rules had not identified many
of the key contrasts. The system is not designed to perform
this task and does not appear suited to the task. There
are two striking differences between the rules produced by
C4.5rules and those produced by the other systems. First,
some of the rules identify relatively small differences in fre-
quency between the two classes. This is presumably because
they are introduced by the system in an attempt to find some
form of discrimination between large numbers of cases that
could not be covered by rules with greater discriminate per-
formance. The second difference is that the rules produced
by C4.5rules contain negative conditions. Because of the
nature of the system there was no way to block this. As our
prior expectation was that negative conditions would not be
of value we configured both STUCCO and Magnum Opus
to prevent them. Due to our strong expectations about the
likely outcomes and our desire to minimize the imposition
on our industry collaborators we decided not to present the
rules produced by C4.5rules for assessment of surprisingness
and potential usefulness. Instead, we presented the set of
rules and asked only for a simple assessment of whether the
negative conditions were of potential value. The following
is a fictitious example of such a rule in the format that we
employed.

On August 21 customers were 5.0 times more
likely to purchase items from department 123
(INFANTS; Diapers) and nothing from department
345 (BEVERAGES; Beer) than they were on August
14. This occurred in 2.5% of transactions on
August 21 and 0.5% of transactions on August 14.

The response from our industry collaborators was that while
negative conditions of these form were of potential value,
these specific rules did not appear to be of interest and
were more difficult to interpret than the Magnum Opus and
STUCCO rules.
This response is an interesting one. While it provides
some support for our belief that classification rule discovery
is not an appropriate approach to contrast discovery, it in-
dicates that techniques that develop contrasts with negative
conditions may be of value in at least this application. To
develop useful techniques of this form may be quite a chal-
lenge, as straightforward application of either STUCCO or


264

Magnum Opus with negative conditions enabled produces
sets of contrasts strongly dominated by negative conditions.
This is because negative conditions have far greater cover
than positive conditions and hence have greater potential to
produce rules with strong effects. However, our intuition is
that negative conditions will only be considered valuable in
the current application when their effect is quite exceptional.


5. CONCLUSIONS
We set out to compare the performance of three alter-
native data mining techniques on a contrast-discovery task.
To our surprise we discovered that the core contrast-set-
discovery task as defined by Eq. 1 is strictly equivalent to a
special case of the more general rule-discovery task (Eq. 8).
This in no way devalues the key contribution of Bay and
Pazzani [2], which is the identification of contrast discovery
as a new and valuable data mining task and the characteri-
zation of its requirements.
From our study and analysis we reach the following con-
clusions about contrast analysis and identify the following
issues as worthy of further investigation.
First, the application of some form of filter to remove spu-
rious correlations is important. The exact form that such a
filter should take is, however, an area that is ripe for further
research. Our investigation suggests that neither STUCCO
nor Magnum Opus is applying a perfect filter. STUCCO
seems to discard some contrasts of potential value. Mag-
num Opus appears to include some contrasts that are very
probably spurious. However, in our study both systems were
applied with default settings, and it is likely that tuning of
their existing mechanisms to the specific task would result
in better performance.
It would be interesting to investigate in greater depth the
issue of whether there is a substantial difference between
the application of a chi-square test of independence and a
binomial sign test as a filter.
It would also be interesting to investigate further the rel-
ative merits of adjusting the statistical tests to allow for
multiple comparisons. Our belief is that it is inadvisable to
do so, because it will result in unacceptable type-two error.
Rather, we should take account of the likelihood of type-one
error in the assessment and investigations subsequent to the
initial contrast-discovery process.
Another issue revealed by our research is the need for
appropriate methods to describe the contrasts that are dis-
covered. It is clear that the traditional association-rule mea-
sures of support, confidence and lift are not directly appro-
priate. It is likely, however, that related measures would
be useful. It would be valuable to study what information
users find useful and how that information can be presented
clearly and concisely.
In summary, the current research has heightened our ap-
preciation of the importance of contrast analysis. As our
theorem proves, existing rule-discovery techniques can be
applied to perform the core contrast-discovery task. How-
ever, it is possible that new techniques are required for filter-
ing the contrasts that are considered potentially interesting.
Finally, there is a need to develop appropriate methods for
describing contrasts to end-users.
