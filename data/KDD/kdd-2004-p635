ABSTRACT
A coCluster of a m О n matrix X is a submatrix determined
by a subset of the rows and a subset of the columns. The
problem of finding coClusters with specific properties is of
interest, in particular, in the analysis of microarray exper-
iments. In that case the entries of the matrix X are the
expression levels of m genes in each of n tissue samples.
One goal of the analysis is to extract a subset of the sam-
ples and a subset of the genes, such that the expression lev-
els of the chosen genes behave similarly across the subset of
the samples, presumably reflecting an underlying regulatory
mechanism governing the expression level of the genes.
We propose to base the similarity of the genes in a co-
Cluster on a simple biological model, in which the strength
of the regulatory mechanism in sample j is Hj, and the re-
sponse strength of gene i to the regulatory mechanism is
Gi. In other words, every two genes participating in a good
coCluster should have expression values in each of the par-
ticipating samples, whose ratio is a constant depending only
on the two genes. Noise in the expression levels of genes is
taken into account by allowing a deviation from the model,
measured by a relative error criterion. The sleeve-width of
the coCluster reflects the extent to which entry i, j in the
coCluster is allowed to deviate, relatively, from being ex-
pressed as the product GiHj.
We present a polynomial-time Monte-Carlo algorithm which
outputs a list of coClusters whose sleeve-widths do not ex-
ceed a prespecified value. Moreover, we prove that the list
includes, with fixed probability, a coCluster which is near-
optimal in its dimensions. Extensive experimentation with
synthetic data shows that the algorithm performs well.

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM
A coCluster of a mОn matrix X is a submatrix determined
by a subset I of the rows and a subset J of the columns.
Recently many researchers have addressed the problem of
finding coClusters with specific properties. One such direc-
tion of research originated in mining high dimensional data,
in particular projected clustering, [1], [2], [3], [13], [16]. An-
other direction resulted from the analysis of microarray ex-
periments.
In that case the entries of the matrix X are
the expression levels of m genes in each of n tissue samples.
One goal of the analysis is to extract a subset of the samples
and a subset of the genes, such that the expression levels of
the chosen genes behave similarly across the subset of the
samples, presumably reflecting an underlying co-regulation,
[4], [5], [6], [7], [10], [11], [12], [14], [15], [16], [17].
For
concreteness, we will in this introductory section describe
our approach using terminology from microarray analysis,
although its applicability extends beyond this domain, for
example to the analysis of term-document matrices, cf. [8].
Call a sub-matrix determined by a set of genes (rows) I
and a set of samples (columns) J co-varying if for any two
genes i1 and i2 in I the ratio of elements in any sample j  J
is a constant independent of j (but possibly dependent on
i1 and i2): Xi1,j/Xi2,j = ci1,i2 for all j  J. Equivalently,
there is a latent variable, H, whose value for sample j is
Hj, such that the expression level of gene i in sample j
is proportional to Hj, with the constant of proportionality
depending only on the gene: Xi,j  GiHj for all (i, j) 
(I, J).
Presumably, in such a co-varying submatrix, the varia-
tion in the expression levels of the genes can be attributed
primarily to the influence of one (or more) regulators, repre-
sented by H, whereas Gi is indicative of the strength of the
regulation of gene i . We want to emphasize that it is not
assumed that Hj is proportional to the abundance of some
transcription factor in sample j, even if it is the variation
in the latter that is responsible, directly or indirectly, for
the variation in the expression levels. Suppose, for example,
that the functional dependency of the expression level of a
gene on the abundance of a transcription factor, x, is of the
form Gu(x), with G a constant specific to the gene and u(x)

a function common to the up-regulated genes. In the model
described above, Hj is then u(xj) (rather than xj), with xj
the level of the transcription factor in sample j. And the ex-
pression levels of two up-regulated genes 1 and 2 in sample
j are G1Hj, G2Hj.
To allow for noise in the expression levels of genes, we will
look for Gi and Hj such that Xi,j is well approximated by
GiHj. To measure how well Xi,j is approximated by GiHj
it seems natural to adopt the relative error criterion,

1


GiHj
Xi,j
 .

Taking logarithms and setting Ai,j = log Xi,j, Ri = log Gi,
Cj = log Hj, and  = log , the problem becomes one of
finding Ri, Cj such that for all i, j,

-  (Ri + Cj) - Ai,j  .

Definition 1. The sleeve-width of a sub-matrix of A, de-
fined by a subset I of rows and a subset J of columns, is

sw(I, J) = 2 min
R,C
max
iI,jJ
|Ai,j - Ri - Cj|.
(1)


Definition 2. Let 0 < ,  < 1 be fixed parameters. For
w > 0, a coCluster of A of sleeve-width w is a pair (I, J),
with I a subset of the rows and J a subset of the columns,
that satisfies the following conditions.

Size: The number of rows is at least a -fraction of all rows,
|I|  m  2, and the number of columns is at least a
-fraction of all columns, |J|  n  2.

Sleeve-width: sw(I, J)  w, i.e., there are Ri, i  I, and
Cj, j  J, such that |Ai,j - Ri - Cj|  w/2 for all
i  I, j  J. Ri, i  I will be called a column profile
of the coCluster and Cj, j  J will be called a row
profile.

Thus, for any gene i in a coCluster there is a shift Ri which
places its row Ai,j, j  J of expression values within a sleeve
of width w surrounding the row profile of the coCluster.
Remark: Clearly the profiles are not unique, e.g., Ri+Cj =
(Ri+a)+(Cj -a) for all i, j and a fixed a. Thus an arbitrary
Ri or Cj can be fixed at 0.
Summarizing, we propose to identify subsets of genes that
are purportedly co-regulated in a subset of the samples, by
log-transforming the expression-data matrix, and then find-
ing in it coClusters of small sleeve-width, w. Observe that,
in contrast to a singular value decomposition, the values Gi
and Hj found by this method, are guaranteed to be non-
negative.
Subsection 2.1 describes a Monte-Carlo algorithm for ex-
tracting a list of coClusters all guaranteed to be of sleeve-
width w. Then it is proven in subsection 2.2 that the list
contains, with fixed probability, a coCluster that is near-
optimal in a sense described there.
Section 4 explains how to compute the sleeve-width of a
given coCluster.
The results of experiments investigating
properties of the algorithm and its parameters, performed
on synthetic data sets, are presented in section 3.
The approach developed here was stimulated by the work
of Cheng and Church [6], who also sought submatrices of A
whose entries are approximated well by Ri + Cj, but mea-
sured the discrepancy using the mean squared residue score;
they called such matrices biclusters. Further work in this
direction includes that of Yang, Wang, Wang and Yu, [17],
and of Cho, Dhillon, Guan and Sra [7]. However, the mean
squared residue score has some undesirable features: the
score of a bicluster can be smaller than the score of a sub-
matrix of this bicluster, the score is insensitive to outliers,
and the connection to a regulatory model is unclear. In ad-
dition, we expect that our approach will find smaller sets of
genes with tighter co-regulation patterns.
In another direction, our results owe much to the work
of Procopiuc, Jones, Agarwal and Murali [13] on projective
clustering, which also formed the basis of the work of Murali
and Kasif [12] on gene expression motifs.
These authors
looked for coClusters in which all the expression values of a
row of the coCluster have to fit within a sleeve around the
exact same row profile, arg minC maxi
I,jJ
|Ai,j-Cj|. We,
on the other hand, permit shifting each row by an individual
fixed amount, so as to place it within a sleeve around the
row profile.
In a vein similar to ours, Wang, Wang, Yang, and Yu,
[16] proposed an algorithm which finds coClusters with the
property that any pair of rows in the coCluster have sleeve-
width at most w/2. It follows from Theorem 2.1 that the
cluster as a whole has then in fact sleeve-width w at most,
in our terminology. The running time of their algorithm is,
however, exponential.

Figure 1: Algorithm for finding sleeved coClusters

Figure 1 presents a Monte Carlo algorithm, RSleeve,
which outputs a list of coClusters which are guaranteed to
have sleeve-width not exceeding w, cf. Theorem 2.1. More-
over, it will be proven in the next subsection that the al-
gorithm possesses the following near-optimality property:
with fixed probability at least one of the coClusters on the
list, (I, J), contains a coCluster, (I, J), of sleeve-width w/2
which is optimal in a sense that will be defined formally in
the next subsection. Roughly speaking, (I, J) is optimal in
the balance it strikes between the number of rows and the
number of columns.

Implementation notes.
1. The computation of sw(D, {s, j}) needed in line 7 is easy:

sw(D, {s, j}) =
1
2 (max
iD
(Ai,j - Ai,s) - min
iD
(Ai,j - Ai,s)),

cf. Theorem 4.1. A similar result holds for sw({r, i}, J) in
line 11.
2. Although the coClusters returned by the algorithm are
guaranteed to have sleeve-width w at most, they may well
have smaller sleeve-width in actual fact.
For this reason
line 13 computes sw(I, J); the algorithm for doing this is
detailed in section 4.
We now prove that all coClusters returned by the algo-
rithm do indeed have sleeve-width w.

Theorem 2.1. Let I be a set of row indices, and let r  I.
If sw({r, i}, J)  w/2 for each i  I, then sw(I, J)  w.
Thus each coCluster (I, J) returned by RSleeve has sleeve-
width at most w.

Proof. Consider the definition of sleeve-width, equation
(1). Fix i  I. Since sw({r, i}, J)  w/2, there are Ri and
Rr as well as Cij, j  J, such that

2|Ai,j - Ri - Cij| 
1
2 w,
2|Ar,j - Rr - Cij| 
1
2 w,
j  J.

Hence |Ai,j - Ar,j - Ri + Rr|  w/2 for all j  J and each
fixed i  I. In fact, according to the remark after definition
2, we can always set Rr = 0. It follows that

sw(I, J)  2 max
iI,jJ
|Ai,j - Ri - Ar,j|  w.



Remark: The bound sw(I, J)  w cannot be improved,
since it becomes tight as max{m, n}  .
Namely, for
each n there exists a n О n matrix such that every pair of
rows has sleeve-width
n
n-1
, whereas the matrix as a whole
has sleeve-width 2.

2.2 Near-optimality of the algorithm
Algorithm RSleeve can be viewed as a heuristic, and the
experimental evidence of section 3 shows it to be efficacious.
This subsection proves that there are good theoretical rea-
sons for its efficacy.
Suppose there are several coClusters of the same sleeve-
width. Which one is to be preferred? coClusters could be
ranked by perimeter, |I| + |J|, or area, |I| и |J|. But in the
context under consideration, the number of rows is several
orders of magnitude larger than the number of columns. It
makes sense, then, as Procopiuc, Jones, Agarwal and Murali
[13] proposed, to specify a trade-off between the number
of rows and the number of columns in the coCluster: the
inclusion of an additional column in J is worth the exclusion
of at most a (1-)-fraction of the rows in I. We adopt their
proposal and rank coClusters by their measure.

Definition 3. The rating of a coCluster (I, J) is х(|I|, |J|),
where х(x, y) = x(1/)y, for fixed .

With this definition our problem can be rephrased as one
of finding an optimal coCluster of sleeve-width w, one with
the maximum rating.
The main result of this subsection is Theorem 2.3. Para-
phrased it states that if the algorithm is run long enough,
then the list returned by the algorithm contains with fixed
probability a coCluster (I, J) of sleeve-width w, whose rat-
ing is at least as good as that of an optimal coCluster of
sleeve-width w/2.
The central insight of Procopiuc, Jones, Agarwal and Mu-
rali [13], in terms of the present context, is that in an optimal
coCluster there must be a relatively small subset of rows, of
size O(log n), that determines which columns participate in
the cluster.

Definition 4. Let (I, J) be a coCluster of sleeve-width w,
and let s  J. D  I is a discriminating set for (I, J) with
respect to s if it satisfies

1. sw(D, {s, j})  w for all j  J;

2. sw(D, {s, j}) > w for all j /
 J.

It is therefore a simple matter to determine J, once s and
D are known. The next lemma shows that discriminating
sets, with respect to any s  J, are both small and plen-
tiful in an optimal coCluster (I, J). Consequently in our
Algorithm RSleeve, both s and D are guessed at, and then
J is deduced in line 7.

Lemma 2.2. Let (I, J) be an optimal coCluster of sleeve-
width w, with |I|  m, and let s be a column in J. Let
D be a randomly chosen subset of I of size d. Then with
probability at least
1
2
, D is a discriminating set for J with
respect to s, provided d  log(2n)/ log(1/3).
Proof. Let Ri , i  I be a column profile, and Cj , j 
J a row profile for (I, J). Condition (1) of the definition
4 of a discriminating set is certainly met, since {s, j}  J,
and so sw(D, {s, j})  sw(D, J)  sw(I, J)  w.
Therefore D fails to be a discriminating set for J with re-
spect to s, only if there is a j /
 J such that sw(D,{s,j}) 
w. The proof will be completed by showing next that the
probability of this happening for a particular j is at most
(3)d, so that the probability of it happening for some j is
bounded by n(3)d 
1
2
.
By definition, sw(D, {s, j})  w means that there are
Cj, Cs, and Ri, i  D such that

|Ai,j -Ri-Cj| 
1
2 w,
|Ai,s-Ri-Cs| 
1
2 w,
for all i  D.

Hence |Ai,j -Ai,s-C|  w for all i  D, and some C(= Cj -
Cs). We want to show that there are no more than 3|I|
rows i that satisfy this inequality, because the coCluster is
optimal.
Observe first of all that if |Ai,j - Ai,s - C|  w then

(Ai,s-Ri -Cs )-w  Ai,j-Ri -C-Cs  (Ai,s-Ri -Cs )+w.

Since |Ai,s - Ri - Cs |  w/2 for i  I, it follows that
-32w  Ai,j - Ri - C - Cs 
3
2
w.
Now the optimality of (I, J) implies that if there is a
subset of rows, I  I, and a j /
 J such that |Ai,j -
Ri - c|  w for some c and all i  I, then |I|  |I|;
for otherwise (I, J), with J = J  {j}, is a coCluster of
sleeve-width w satisfying х(I, J) > х(I, J), contradicting
the optimality of (I, J).
Therefore, for each j /
 J and each of the intervals

[- 3
2 w,
-1
2 w
], [- 1
2 w,
1
2 w
], [ 1
2 w,
3
2 w
],

there are at most |I| rows i such that Ai,j - Ri - c - Cs
lies in that interval. Thus there are at most 3|I| rows that
satisfy |Ai,j - Ai,s - C|  w.

Definition 5. Let (I, J) be an optimal coCluster of sleeve-
width w. An integer d will be called acceptable for (I, J)
if it has the following property. If a subset D  I of size
d as well as a column s  J are chosen at random, then D
is a discriminating set for (I, J) with respect to s, with
probability 1/2 at least.

According to the lemma any d  log(2n)/ log(1/3) is ac-
ceptable. Our experiments on synthetic data, reported on
in section 4, showed this bound to be wildly pessimistic: a
random subset of size 5 of the rows of a coCluster, was found
to be a discriminating set with probability 1.

Theorem 2.3. Assume that A contains an optimal co-
Cluster, (I, J), of sleeve-width w/2, and let d be acceptable
for (I, J). Then, with probability at least 1/2, algorithm
RSleeve returns a coCluster of sleeve-width w, (I, J), such
that I  I and J = J, provided
R
 (2/)dln4, and

S
 2/ .

Proof. The probability that a particular choice of D in
the outer loop satisfies D  I is at least d, since |D| = d,
and |I|  m. By assumption, given that D  I it is
with probability at least
1
2
a discriminating set for J with
respect to s. Hence the probability that all
R
iterations of
the outer loop fail to find a discriminating set for J does
not exceed (1 -
1
2
d)
R
 1/4.
Similarly, since |J|  m, a particular choice of s in the
inner loop over columns satisfies s  J with probability
at least . Therefore the probability that the inner loop
fails to find an s  J in all its
S
iterations is at most
(1 - )
S
< 1/4.
It follows that RSleeve chances upon a s  J and a
discriminating set D  I with probability at least 3/4 и
3/4 > 1/2. When it does, it finds J = J in lines. The
resulting I it then computes, necessarily satisfies I  I.
Indeed, for any i  I and all j  J

sw({r, i}, J)  sw(I, J) 
1
2 w.

Thus i  I.

2.3 Running time
The inner for-loops take O(mn) time. The total number
of iterations is upper bounded by Theorem 2.3 as
S
R
=
(2/)d2/. The experiments reported on in subsection 3.3
show that d can be taken as 3, and that the number of iter-
ations of the algorithm is always much less than 16/(3).
We note that because of its inherent parallelism the algo-
rithm can easily benefit from special-purpose hardware.

2.4 Extensions

1. Instead of setting w a priori, RSleeve could pick a
different w for each choice of D.
For example, the
for-loop of line 6 can be replaced by one that first
computes sw(D, {s, j}), and then sets w for the current
D according to some density considerations.

2. In line 11 of the algorithm, candidate rows could be
tested against all of the discriminating set, rather than
just against r. Preliminary testing of this idea indi-
cates that it speeds up the finding of coClusters by
some 25% on average.
3. EXPERIMENTS ON SYNTHETIC DATA
We report here on the results of simulations using syn-
thetically generated data, performed on an Intel Xeon CPU
2.40GHz dual processor with 512 KB cache size, running
Linux operating system. The purpose of the simulations was
to evaluate various aspects of the RSleeve algorithm, that
can only be assessed with synthetic data. Specific questions
we wanted to address were the following.

1. How should the sleeve-width be chosen so that the
significant coClusters are found, without introducing
artifacts ?

2. What is the size of the discriminating set, d, needed
in practice? The bound d  log(2n)/ log(1/3), is of
necessity a rough one, and it involves the parameter
, which a user may be loath to specify.

3. How many iterations are needed to find all significant
clusters? Theorem 2.3 provides a functional relation-
ship which involves the unknown size of the discrimi-
nating set. We wanted also to assess what effect the
presence of multiple, possibly overlapping, coClusters
has on the running time.

In each simulation run a random matrix of m = 20, 000
rows and n = 100 columns was first generated, by setting
the (i, j)-th entry of the matrix to a random integer number
in the range [0, 1000].

3.1 Choice of sleeve-width
In general, the sleeve-width approach tends to produce
tight coClusters. In our experience, setting w to 5% of the
range of values of the matrix provides a good balance be-
tween including most of the significant coClusters without
introducing spurious ones due to noise.
For example, in
their analysis of the cell-cycle yeast data, Chen and Church
[6] adopted a value of 300 for their parameter . This pa-
rameter measures the average squared residual of a coClus-
ter; therefore a coCluster of sleeve-width w has a value of
  w2/4. Their  = 300 corresponds then to our w = 30,
which is close to 5% of the yeast data range, [0,600].

In order to test our intuition, we selected one million sub-
matrices at random, for each combination of coCluster di-
mensions, and computed for each the sleeve-width. From
the accumulated results we report, in Table 1, the low, high
and peak sleeve-widths found in terms of percentage of the
range. The larger the submatrix the closer to 100% of the
range its sleeve-width is expected to be. The last column
states the percentage of cases that had a sleeve-width of 5%

or less. It shows that there is an insignificant probability of
finding a coCluster with such a sleeve-width in all cases of
interest.

3.2 Size of discriminating set
The determination of a discriminating set is a central part
of algorithm RSleeve. It appears from Lemma 2.2 as if the
size of this set is dependent on the parameter  measur-
ing the trade-off of importance between rows and columns.
Not only is specifying  not something we want to burden
a user with, but also the bound provided by Lemma 2.2
is a very coarse one. Moreover, the notion of a discrimi-
nating set would seem not to need a tie-in to this trade-
off. To test these ideas we performed the following exper-
iments. After fixing the number of columns at 5, 40, 60 or
80 ( = 0.05, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 respectively), a random coClus-
ter with the given number of columns was generated and
planted in the random matrix. Then a subset of size d of
the rows of the coCluster was chosen at random 100,000
times , for d  {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.

coClusters with  = 0.05, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8.

Figure 2 presents a plot of the percentage of cases in which
the chosen subset actually was a discriminating set, as a
function of d. The important finding from this experiment
is that already a random subset of size 4 is a discriminating
set with probability greater than 0.7. Since d appears as
an exponent in the estimated running time, we chose d =
3 in the following experiments. The plot shows also that
coClusters with fewer columns require larger discriminating
sets. The reason is that the discriminating set has to filter
out more columns not belonging to the coCluster.

3.3 Number of iterations of the algorithm
To test the number of inner iterations of the algorithm,
estimated in subsection 2.3 as ((2/)d2/), we generated
random data in a manner analogous to the one discussed
by Procopiuc, Jones, Agarwal and Murali [13].
All data
generated had values in the range [0, 1000] and were either
cluster points or noise. Each data matrix had m = 20, 000
rows and n = 100 columns, and contained K = 5 clusters.
After initializing the m О n matrix with random data, the
coClusters were generated by the following steps.

1. To determine the number of rows mk of the coClus-
ter k, we first drew random constants of proportion-
ality rk in the range [1, 6], and computed mk = m и
rk/ PK
k=1
ri.
Following [13], the imbalance between
cluster sizes was increased by setting mk = mk, and
mk+
K/2
= mk
+K/2
+ (1 - )mk, with  a parame-
ter. We report here only on results with  = 0.5, be-
cause the differences with the other values we tried,
  {0.2, 0.33, 0.5}, were not significant.

2. The number of columns of a cluster was set as a ran-
dom integer in the range [35, 45]. In addition, when
generating cluster k + 1, half of its columns were cho-
sen from among the columns of coCluster k, in attempt
to model the sharing of columns between different co-
Clusters.

3. The values of the entries of coCluster k were gener-
ated as follows (supplanting the previously generated
random values of the matrix).
The values of R(
k)
i
,
associated with the rows of coCluster k, were gener-
ated uniformly at random in [0, 500]. The values of
C(
k)
j
, associated with its columns, were also generated
uniformly at random in [0, 500] (if not already set pre-
viously). The value of entry (i, j) of coCluster k was
then set to R(
k)
i
+ C(
k)
j
. Finally noise was added, as a
uniform random integer in the range [-25, 25], corre-
sponding to a sleeve-width of 5%.

The outer loops were run, with d = 3, until all coClusters
had been identified. Denote by N the number of iterations
needed to retrieve a specific coCluster.

4. COMPUTING THE SLEEVE-WIDTH
In this section all of the rows and columns of A are taken
into account when computing the sleeve-width. By defini-
tion,

sw(A) = min
R,C
{ A - B
M
: Bi,j = Ri + Cj, i, j},
(2)

with A
M
= maxi,j |Ai,j| the matrix max norm. A similar
notion was used in [6], [7], [11], and [17]. However, they

employed the Frobenius norm,


A

F
=
m
X
i=1
n
X
j=1
A2i,j.


In that case it is easily seen that for the best R, C,

Ri + Cj =

For the matrix max norm employed here, there is usually
no explicit form for the best R, C, except in the special
case considered in subsection 4.1.
Subsection 4.2 presents an algorithm for computing the
sleeve-width of a general matrix; it is a discrete version of
the Diliberto-Straus algorithm [9].

4.1 A matrix with two columns

Theorem 4.1. Let A be a m О 2 matrix. Then
sw(A) =
1
2
(maxi(Ai,
1
- Ai,
2
) - mini(Ai,
1
- Ai,
2
)).

An explicit solution can also be computed, as follows. First
permute the rows of A so that

A1
,1
- A1
,2
 A2
,1
- A2
,2
 иии  Am,
1
- Am,
2
.

Set  = sw(A), h = (A1
,1
- A1
,2
+ Am,
1
- Am,
2
)/2, and
let
be such that A
,1
- A
,2
 h  A
+1,1
- A
+1,2
. Then
CT =< 0, -h >, and

RT =< A1
,1
+, A2

+, . . . , A

+, A

4.2 Iterative algorithm for general matrix
Define the row-midpoint and column-midpoint operators,
PR(A), PC(A), as follows.

PR(A)i =
1
2 (max
Ai, + min Ai, ),

PC(A)j =
1
2 (max
A
,j
+ min A
,j
).

Starting with initial R(0), C(0), and E(0)
i,j
= Ai,j-R(0)
i
-C(0)
j
,
the algorithm computes for k = 1, 2, . . .

R(
k+1)
= PR(E(2
k)
), C(
k+1)
= PC(E(2
k+1)
),

E(2
k+1)
i,j
= E(2
k)
i,j
- R(
k+1)
i
,

E(2
k+2)
i,j
= E(2
k+1)
i,j
- C(k
+1)
j
, 1  i  m, 1  j  n.

If desired the algorithm also maintains

R(
k+1)
= R(
k)
+ R(
k+1)
, C(
k+1)
= C(
k)
+ C(
k+1)
.

Theorem 4.2. The DS-algorithm converges for any ini-
tial B(0). Moreover, the sequence
E(
k)
M
decreases mono-
tonically to
1
2
sw(A), and if for some k

E(
k)
M
= E(
k+1)
M
= E(
k+2)
M
,

then 2 E(
k)
M
= sw(A) and R(
k)
, C(
k)
are optimal column
and row profiles.
