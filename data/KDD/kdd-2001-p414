ABSTRACT

The goal of Path Analysis is to understand visitors' navigation
of a Web site. The fundamental analysis component is a path. A
path is a finite sequence of elements, typically representing
URLs or groups ofURLs. A full path is an abstraction of a visit
or a session, which can contain attributes described below.
Subpaths represent interesting subsequences of the full paths.

Path Analysis provides user-confignrable extraction, filtering,
preprocessing, noise reduction, descriptive statistics and
detailed analysis of three basic specific objects: elements,
(sub)paths, and couples of elements. In each case, lists of
frequent objects -- subject to particular filtering and sorting --
are available. We call the corresponding interactive tools
Element, Path, and CoupleAnalyzers.

We also allow in-depth exploration of individual elements,
paths, and couples: Element Explorer investigates composition
and convergence of traffic through an element and allows
conditioning based on the number of preceding/succeeding
steps. Path Explorer visualizes in and out flows of a path and
attrition rate along the path. CoupleExplorer presents distinct
paths connecting couple elements, along with measures of their
association and some additional statistics.


1. INTRODUCTION
Path Analysis provides a comprehensive analysis of visitors'
navigation of a Web site. We use the term analysis instead of
the word reporting to stress the interactive and detailed nature
of the techniques we present. Identification of Web site traffic
patterns is important for designing a more efficient and user-
friendly site, discovering potentially misleading, duplicate, or
overlapping content, and understanding the effectiveness of
referring links. Most importantly, it enables a broad variety of
business applications.

AfuUpath is a finite sequence of elements (a b... c) typically
representing URLs or groups of URLs. The concept of a full
path is an abstraction of a visit or a session. A full path can
more generally contain additional business, timing, or visitor-
related attributes. Any contiguous subsequence of a full path is
a subpath, or simply a path. We also use the term couple to
describe an ordered pair <a,b> of elements that occur in some
path. As we will demonstrate, there is a certain duality between
the concepts of a path and a couple. Elements, paths and
couples are the three fundamental objects of path analysis.

Our path analysis implementation is built on top of an
enterprise class e-business analysis platform called Accrue G2
[1]. Accrue G2 provides a rich infrastructure for Web traffic
analysis. It collects visitor activity through a proprietary
network collector (packet sniffing of http traffic), Web server
plug-ins, or Web server log files." Accrue G2 shields our
implementation from many technical problems related to
acquisition, transformation, and preprocessing of the Web site
data. For example, our implementation does not need to be
concerned
with
sessionizing (see
[4])
or
spider/robot
identification.

We operate in two main phases: In the pre-processing phase,
we extract data from the G2 repository, perform sampling,
filtering, and noise reduction, compute general descriptive
statistics, and construct compressed
data structures
for
supporting later interactive analysis. A critical characteristic of
this phase is scalability, as the raw volume of data operated on
can be very large.

The efficient data structures constructed during the pre-
processing phase enable the interactivephase. The interactive
phase provides the user with a broad variety of tools to
investigate elements, paths, and couples. These tools include
detailed analysis and exploration. The analysis tools provide
filtered and sorted lists of these objects. The exploration tools
provide valuable insights into the structure of a specific object
and its relationship to other objects. Altogether, there are six
major interactive tools:

ElementAnalyzer
Element Explorer

Path Analyzer
Path Explorer

CoupleAnalyzer
CoupleExplorer

All the tools provide a number of additional measures,
including frequency, coverage, and associations. The interactive
phase is easy to use and provides rich analysis. A critical
characteristic of the interactive phase is that it is fast. Software
implementation of interactive phase uses XML for the client-
server communication. We plan to make this API public for
developers of third party tools.


2. PRE-PROCESSING
The pre-processing phase consists of two major steps: data
extraction and data preparation.

The Data extraction step selects Path Analysis data from
Accrue G2 or another appropriate repository and passes it
through the following logical stages:

Data Repository -->E--->S-->M-->P-->F--->
Input Path Set.

E is the physical Extraction of paths (potentially with pre-
computed frequencies). Some configuration parameters are
available.

S is Sampling, a standard data mining technique to reduce the
size of the data. It can also be used to research stability and
confidence intervals of computed characteristics.

M is Mapping or encoding of elements (URLs or groups of
URLs) into integers. One special feature during the mapping is
called factorization. Factorization allows the user to examine
paths at different levels of granularity; consequently the user
ignores irrelevant details by zooming out to a broader view.
The simplest factorization implementation is based on the
content hierarchy.

P is optional Preprocessing of path data to incorporate useful
transformations that are most relevant for a particular
application. Examples include elimination
of consecutive
repetitions ((a,a,b,c,c,c) ----> (a,b,c)), or trimming of elements
located far from pages corresponding to business events.

F is Filtering in which conditions are specified to select a
particular subset of all the input full paths. The conditions
include: date and time, starting and ending elements or groups
of elements, referrers or groups of referrers, visitor groups, and
particular business events attributable to a whole path (e.g.,
registration, purchase, session length, etc).

The Data preparation step results in data compression and
noise reduction. Two types of noise reduction controls are
available: frequency and coverage. First, the user can specify a
minimum frequency, so that paths with lower frequencies are
discarded. Second, the user can specify a coverage limit. Low
frequency paths are discarded (reducing the coverage) until the
coverage limit is reached. The second mechanism alleviates a
potential imbalance in the first approach due to the fact that
shorter paths have a tendency to be more frequent. Table 1
presents an actual example of 1164619 paths collected over one
day. The columns contain the compression coefficient and the
coverage for this data set without any noise reduction (MF=I),
and with noise reduction corresponding to minimal frequency

into special data
structures to enable fast querying during the interactive phase.
These structures are mainly fixed length path sets sorted by
certain suffixes, prefixes, and other task specific orderings.
Task specific orderings allow logarithmically quick searches
that relate to the query of a particular tool. An example of such
a query is a request for all in-flows to a particular focus path
(see section 4 below). Care is taken to maintain and sort
references to the underlying list elements rather than the list
elements themselves. Exploiting references allows significant
savings in memory usage. Due to a lack of space, we plan to
describe related data structures in a separate publication.

At this point a broad variety of descriptive statistics are
computed, which provide a snapshot of the Web site traffic.
These statistics include:

Number of extracted, retained, discarded, and unique
elements and full paths, along with corresponding compression
coefficients and coverage ratios;

- Length related statistics for full paths (example: conditional
average length of paths longer than a given length), and the
distributions of extracted and retained full paths by length ;

- Attrition, compression and coverage by length for full retained
paths and distribution by length of fixed length (sub)paths;

- Statistics for paths of special nature, such as constant paths
(e.g., (a a ...
a), circular-2 paths (e.g., (a b a b ... ), and
cyclic paths (e.g., (a ... a).


3. ANALYSIS AND EXPLORATION OF
ELEMENTS
Element Analyzer presents elements sorted by their overall
frequency, their session entry or exit frequency, or their
occurrence as paths of length one. In particular, this
information provides the simplest means to find confident
changes or trends in traffic data from one run to another.

Element Explorer deals with issues of composition and
convergence of traffic to and from a particular element. The
simplest question to ask is what are the immediate (l-step)
predecessors and successors of an clement a. The question can
be generalized. An element x is a k-step predecessor of a if
there is a path (x zl ... zk-l a). The analogous definition holds
for a successor y. If the number of such paths (with different z)
is N(k,x,a) and frequency of a is N(a), then the conditional
probability, N(k,x,a)/N(a), shows the fraction of a-traffic that
arrives from x in k steps. An array of these probabilities for
different x describes a composition
of a-th predecessors.
Altogether, three questions can be asked. To demonstrate the
symmetry between predecessors and successors, we formulate
all three questions for successors:




415

·
What are the chances that y is a k-step successor of a?
·
What are the chances of reaching y from a in k steps for
the first time?
·
What are the chances of reaching y from a in no more then
k steps?

The two last questions deal with the issue of convergence.
Element Explorer allows the user to specify element a, the
number of steps k, the conditioning element (a or x/y) and the
particular question of interest.


4. ANALYSIS AND EXPLORATION OF
PATHS
Path Analyzer presents the most frequent paths of any or of
fixed length, optionally filtered by starting, ending, or
intermediate groups of elements, or other special criteria (e.g.,
non constant paths only). In a case study of three industrial
sites, Table 2 shows fixed 4-long subpaths. The table cells
contain total coverage (%) of all 4-subpaths by the N most
frequent 4-subpaths.

The most profound business inferences can be made from the
fact that a few high frequency objects of interest cover such a
significantportion of the overall data. This allows us to employ
compression to dramatically decrease queries for additional
information. There is an interesting generalization of this
approach to overlay traffic data with certain business measures,
such as the amount of sales. By assigning a particular weight to
each extracted path, proportional to its business measure, we
can focus the analysis on a particular business goal.

Path Explorer drills into the data related to a particular focus
path. Figure 1 schematically presents path exploration:

Ifthe focus path is (a b c), we would like to know all in-flows

x and out-flows y, along with their corresponding frequencies.
It is also important to be able to expand a focus path in either
direction through an x or y, or to shrink the focus path by
removing an element from either end. To provide a case study
for this paper without divulging proprietary customer data, we
present simplified output (Figure 2) of the encoded data instead
of the actual graphical user interface.

In this output we explore a focus path (4 29 6423 1884). In-
flows are immediate predecessors of the focus path. Out-flows
are corresponding successors. The plus sign identifies a
possible expanding of the path, and the numbers in the brackets
represent frequencies. For example, element 5 preceded the
focus as an in-flow 950 times. Expanding the focus path to the
leR to include the element 5, results in the output in Figure 3,
corresponding to a focus path (5 4 29 6423 1884).

Another view of Path Explorer shows levels of attrition along
the paths (logarithmic scale is used), as illustrated by Figure 4.
For example, 29.95% of traffic through a path (5 4) passed to
the element 29.


5. ANALYSIS AND EXPLORATION OF
COUPLES
Couple Analyzer presents sets of filtered couples sorted by
certain criterion. Recall that a couple is an ordered pair < a,b>
of elements which has occurred in some (sub)path. Frequent
couples are fingerprints of Web site traffic, equally as
interesting as frequent paths.

However, the fact that the number of steps taken to connect a
and b can vary adds extra complexity to the concept of a
couple. In addition to an overall frequency, N(a,b), a couple has
a particular frequency, N(k,a,b), for each number of connecting
steps k, and N(a,b)=~kN(k,a,b). We display the average
number of steps (AvgS in Figure 5) connecting a couple. A
couple with a high average number of steps is a precious
commodity, since it represents a delayed influence. In the
opposite extreme case, a couple with an average step number
equal to one represents a physical link. Filtering out couples
with low relative 1-frequency N(1,a,b)/N(a,b) presents a
customer with a valuable insight to redesign the site by
introducing useful links. Due to the intricacies of modern Web
site design (for example proxy servers), a couple can have a
non-trivial l-frequency without being a link. The details are
beyond the scope of this paper.

Other important information about a couple relates to different
measures of common frequency of couple elements (see Confid
and Simil in Figure 5). Conditional probability P(b]a) =
N(a,b)/N(a) is one such measure. It is known as confidence in
the context of associationrules [2]. We also use a symmetric
measure based on the concept of similarity, s(a,b) =
N(a,b)/fN(a)+N(b)-N(a,b)). Both measures are scaled to (0,1].
In the extreme case when a and b only happen together,
P(b[a)---s(a,b)--1. Filtering for couples with high similarity and
frequency (support) provides an important list of intimately
related URLs.

To provide the reader with some taste of the introduced
concepts, we show a simplified version of Couple Analyzer
output in Figure 5. For example, the first couple happens
47.9% in one step, 22.9% in two steps, and so on with ellipsis
representing remaining infrequent occurrences. Two filters are
employed in this example to exclude cycles and to set minimum
average step to two. In particular, a couple <1038, 1017> is an
instance of a stable user pattern that happens most frequently in
two steps (68%).

Couple Explorer drills into the data related to a particular
couple
<a,h>.
Figure 6
schematically presents
couple
exploration:




Figure 6



There is a duality between Figures 1 and 6. Couple Explorer
tracks all the paths connecting a and b, sorted by frequency (or
by length and frequency). For special couples (say, b is a
checkout or registration page) the most frequent connecting
paths are important from a business perspective. For usability
purposes it is important to filter such paths by different criteria.

filtering by proper paths (connecting path is proper if it
does not contain ends inside),
filtering by including elements,
filtering by non including elements,
filtering by length,
filtering by frequency.

Special vertical applications naturally arise as soon as the
customer provides lists of elements related to particular
business events.


6. FUTURE WORK
We identify the following directions as important for further
development:

- Automatic discovery of interesting objects is essential for
industrial usability. Research of how to configure interesting
objects and what constitutes an interesting object is required.

- Comparison of two or more data sets in order to identify
significant differences. Comparison is important for two
reasons: 1) to identify changes (trends) with respect to time,
and 2) to identify differences between segments of filtered data
(for example, for different groups of customers, referrers, with
and without advertisement, promotion, etc.).

- Predictive mining is an important component of eCRM and
naturally
integrates
with
the
presented
Path
Analysis
infrastructure.
For example,
consider the possibility
of
dynamically updating page content for a customer on a
particular path.


7. RELATED WORK
General sequence analysis has a long history. Applications
cover many fields, including biology C19], [16], information
retrieval [12], [17], and time series [5]. A sequential patterns
approach to retail basket data mining is proposed in [3] and
[18]. Academic and experimental work in Web data analysis is
exploding in popularity. This paper concerns itself with Web
site log data analysis. The significance of frequent long
subsequences was identified in [15]. Elegant measures of Web
page importance are suggested in [7]. For sessionizing Web log
data see [4]. There are successful attempts of general Web net
classification [11], [13] and [14]. Industrial Web mining is
discussed in [10]. Exploratory data analysis of a Web site with
emphasis on human interaction is researched in [8]. Innovative
approaches to visualization of Web data are proposed in [6] and
[9].

Nearly every vendor of Web analysis products provides some
sort of path analysis solution; as such, a complete list is
impractical. Most of these solutions focus on reporting most
frequent paths and provide little, if any, interactivity.


8. CONCLUSIONS
This paper presents a comprehensive approach to the analysis
of Web site traffic. It identifies important underlying objects
and a range of user interfaces for their exploration. The special
data structures used allowed fast interactive analysis of site
elements, paths, and couples, and in-depth exploration of these
objects. An infrasU'ucture is laid out for the flexible
development of business applications, taking advantage of
batch mode and interactive tools to explore site navigation
activity.
