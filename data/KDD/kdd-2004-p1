User-Centered Design for KDD


Eric Haseltine
National Security Agency
Fort Maede, MD




ABSTRACT
During initial development, KDD solutions often focus heav-
ily on algorithms, architectures, software, hardware, and
systems engineering challenges, without first thoroughly ex-
ploring how end-users will employ the new KDD technology.
As a result of such "system-centered" design, many useless
features are implemented that prolong development and sig-
nificantly add to life cycle cost, while making the system
hard to operate and use. This presentation will describe
an alternate "user-centered" approach ­ borrowed from the
consumer products industry ­ that can produce KDD so-
lutions with shorter development cycles, lower costs, and
much better usability.
