ABSTRACT
Identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of unex-
pected, interesting, and useful knowledge. Existing methods
are designed for detecting spatial outliers in multidimen-
sional geometric data sets, where a distance metric is avail-
able. In this paper, we focus on detecting spatial outliers
in graph structured data sets. We define statistical tests,
analyze the statistical foundation underlying our approach,
design several fast algorithms to detect spatial outliers, and
provide a cost model for outlier detection procedures. In ad-
dition, we provide experimental results from the application
of our algorithms on a Minneapolis-St.Paul(Twin Cities)
traffic dataset to show their effectiveness and usefulness.

INTRODUCTION
Outliers have been informally defined as observations which
appear to be inconsistent with the remainder of that set of
data [2], or which deviate so much from other observations
so as to arouse suspicions that they were generated by a dif-
ferent mechanism [5]. The identification of outliers can lead
to the discovery of unexpected knowledge and has a number
of practical applications in areas such as credit card fraud,
the performance analysis of athletes, voting irregularities,

bankruptcy, and weather prediction.
Outliers in a spatial data set can be classified into three
categories: set-based outliers, multi-dimensional space-based
outliers, and graph-based outliers. A set-based outlier is a
data object whose attributes are inconsistent with attribute
values of other objects in a given data set regardless of spa-
tial relationships. Both multi-dimensional space-based out-
liers and graph-based outliers are spatial outliers, that is,
data objects that are significantly different in attribute val-
ues from the collection of data objects among spatial neigh-
borhoods. However, multi-dimensional space-based outliers
and graph-based outliers are based on different spatial neigh-
borhood definitions. In multi-dimensional space-based out-
lier detection, the definition of spatial neighborhood is based
on Euclidean distance, while in graph-based spatial outlier
detections, the definition is based on graph connectivity.
Many spatial outlier detection algorithms have been re-
cently proposed; however, spatial outlier detection remains
challenging for various reasons. First, the choice of a neigh-
borhood is nontrivial. Second,the design of statistical tests
for spatial outliers needs to account for the distribution of
the attribute values at various locations as well as the aggre-
gate distribution of attribute values over the neighborhoods.
In addition, the computation cost of determining parame-
ters for a neighborhood-based test can be high due to the
possibility of join computations.
In this paper, we formulate a general framework for de-
tecting outliers in spatial graph data sets, and propose an ef-
ficient graph-based outlier detection algorithm. We provide
cost models for outlier detection queries, and compare un-
derlying data storage and clustering methods that facilitate
outlier query processing. We also use our basic algorithm to
detect spatial outliers in a Minneapolis-St.Panl(Twin Cities)
traffic data set, and show the correctness and effectiveness
of our approach.

1.1
An Illustrative Application Domain
In 1995, the University of Minnesota and the Traffic Man-
agement Center(TMC) Freeway Operations group started
the development of a database to archive sensor network
measurements from the freeway system in the Twin Cities.
The sensor network includes about nine hundred stations,
each of which contains one to four loop detectors, depending
on the number of lanes. Sensors embedded in the freeways
monitor the occupancy and volume of traffic on the road. At
regular intervals, this information is sent to the Traffic Man-




371

agement Center for operational purposes, e.g., ramp meter
control, and research on traffic modeling and experiments.
In this application, each station exhibits both graph and
attribute properties. The topological space is the map, where
each station represents a node and the connection between
each station and its surrounding stations can be represented
as an edge. The attribute space for each station is the traf-
fic flow information (e.g., volume, occupancy) stored in the
value table. We are interested in discovering the location
of stations whose measurements are inconsistent with those
of their graph-based spatial neighbors and the time periods
when those abnormalities arise. This outlier detection task
is to:
 Build a statistical model for a spatial data set
 Check whether a specific station is an outlier
 Check whether stations on a route are outliers
We use three neighborhood definitions in this applica-
tion as shown in Figure 1.
First, we define a neighbor-
hood based on spatial graph connectivity as a spatial graph
neighborhood. In Figure 1, (sl, t2) and (s3, t2) are the spa-
tial neighbors of (s2,t2) if sl and s3 are connected to s2 in
a spatial graph.
Second, we define a neighborhood based
on time series as a temporal neighborhood.
In Figure 1,
(s2, tl) and (s2, t3) are the temporal neighbors of (s2, t2) if
tl, t2, and ta are consecutive time slots. In addition, we
define a neighborhood based on both space and time series
as a spatial-temporal neighborhood.
In Figure 1, (sl,tl),
(sl,t2), (sl,t3), (s2,tl), (s2,t3), (s3,tl), (s3,t2), and (sa,t3)
are the spatial-temporal neighbors of (s2, t2) if sl and s3 are
connected to s2 in a spatial graph, and tl, t2, and t3 are
consecutive time slots.

Problem Formulation
In this section, we formally define the spatial outlier de-
tection problem. Given a spatial framework S for the un-
derlying spatial graph G, an attribute f over S, and neigh-
borhood relationship R, we can build a model and construct
statistical tests for spatial outliers based on a spatial graph
according to the given confidence level threshold. The prob-
lem is formally defined as follows.

Spatial Outlier Detection Problem

Given:
 A spatial graph G = {S, E}, where S is a spatial frame-
work consisting of locations sl,s2,... ,s,~ and E is a
collection of edges between locations in S
* A neighborhood relationship R consistent with E
 An attribute function f: S --r a set of real numbers
 An aggregate function faggr : R N --~ a set of real numbers
to summarize values of attribute f over a neighbor-
hood relationship R Iv C R
 Confidence level threshold 0

Find:
 A set of spatial outliers

Objective:
 Correctness: outliers identified are significantly differ-
ent from those of their neighborhood
 Efficiency: to minimize the computation time

Constraints:
 Attribute values have a normal distribution
 Size of the data set >> main memory size
 The range of attribute function f is the set of real
numbers
The formulation shows two subtasks in this spatial outlier
detection problem: (a) the design of a statistical model M
and a test for spatial outliers (b) the design of an efficient
computation method to estimate parameters of the test, test
whether a specific spatial location is an outlier, and test
whether spatial locations on a given path are outliers.

RELATED WORK, CONTRIBUTION
Many outlier detection algorithms [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14]
have been recently proposed. These methods can be broadly
classified into two categories, namely set-based outlier detec-
tion methods and spatial-set-based outlier detection meth-
ods. The set-based outlier detection algorithms [2, 6] con-
sider the statistical distribution of attribute values, ignoring
the spatial relationships among items. Numerous outlier de-
tection tests, known as discordancy tests [2, 6], have been
developed for different circumstances, depending on the data
distribution, the number of expected outliers, and the types
of expected outliers. The main idea is to fit the data set to
a known standard distribution, and develop a test based on
distribution properties.
Spatial-set-based outlier detection methods consider both
attribute values and spatial relationships. They can be fur-
ther grouped into two categories, namely multi-dimensional
metric space-based methods and graph-based methods. The
multi-dimensional metric space-based methods model data
sets as a collection of points in a multidimensional space,
and provide tests based on concepts such as distance, den-
sity, and convex-hull depth. We discuss different example
tests now. Knorr and Ng presented the notion of distance-
based outliers [7, 8]. For a k dimensional data set T with N
objects, an object O in T is a DB(p, D)-outlier if at least
a fraction p of the objects in T lies greater than distance
D from O. Ramaswamy et al. [11] proposed a formulation
for distance-based outliers based on the distance of a point
from its k*n nearest neighbor. After ranking points by the
distance to its k*h nearest neighbor, the top n points axe
declared as outliers. Breunig et al. [3] introduced the notion
of a "local" outlier where the outlier-degree of an object is
determined by taking into account the clustering structure
in a bounded neighborhood of the object, e.g., k nearest
neighbors.
In computational geometry, some depth-based
approaches [12, 10] organize data objects in convex hull lay-
ers in data space according to their peeling depth [10], and




372

outliers are expected to be found from data objects with a
shallow depth value. Yu et al. [14] introduced an outlier de-
tection approach, called FindOut, which identifies outliers
by removing clusters from the original data.
Methods for detecting outliers in multi-dimensional Eu-
clidean space have several limitations. First, multi-dimensional
approaches assume that the data items are embedded in a
isometric metric space and do not capture the spatial graph
structure. Secondly, they do not exploit apriori information
about the statistical distribution of attribute data.
Last,
they seldom provide a confidence measure of the discovered
outliers.
In this paper, we formulate a general framework for de-
tecting spatial outliers in a spatial data set with an underly-
ing graph structure. We define neighborhood-based statis-
tics and validate the statistical distribution. We then design
a statistically correct test for discovering spatial outliers,
and develop a fast algorithm to estimate model parameters,
as well as to determine the results of a spatial outlier test
on a given item. In addition, we evaluate our method in a
Twin Cities traffic data set and show the effectiveness and
usefulness of our approach.


3.
OUR APPROACH
In this section, we list the key design decisions and propose
an I/O efficient algorithm for spatial graph-based outliers.

3.1
Choice of Spatial Statistic
For spatial statistics, several parameters should be pre-
determined before running the spatial outlier test.
First,
the neighborhood can be selected based on a fixed cardinal-
ity or a fixed graph distance or a fixed Euclidean distance.
Second, the choice of neighborhood aggregate function can
be mean, variance, or auto-correlation. Third, the choice for
comparing a location with its neighbors can be either just a
number or a vector of attribute values. Finally, the statis-
tic for the base distribution can be selected from various
choices.
The statistic we used is S(x) = [f(x) - E~eN(~)(f(y))],
where f(x) is the attribute value for a data record x, N(x) is
the fixed cardinality set of neighbors of x, and E~eN(=)(f(y))
is the average attribute value for neighbors of x. Statistic
S(x) denotes the difference of the attribute value of each
data object x and the average attribute value of x's neigh-
bors.


LEMMA 1. Spatial Statistic S(x) = [f(x)-EyeN(=)(f(y) )]
is normally distributed if attribute value f(x) is normally
distributed.
Proof:
Given the definition of neighborhood, for each data record
x, the average attribute values E~eN(=)(f(y)) of x's k neigh-
bors can be calculated.
Since attribute values f(x) are
normally distributed and an average of normal variables
is also normally distributed, the average attribute values
E~N(=)(f(y)) over neighbors is also a normal distribution
for a fixed cardinality neighborhood.
Since the attribute value and the average attribute value
over neighbors are two normal variable, the distribution of
the difference of S(x) of each data object x and the average
attribute value of x% neighbors is also normally distributed.

3.2
Test for Outlier Detection
The test for detecting an outlier can be described as
> 0. For each data object x with an attribute
'$
value f(x), the S(x) is the difference of the attribute value
of data object x and the average attribute value of its neigh-
bors; #s is the mean value of all S(x), and as is the standard
deviation of all S(x). The choice of 0 depends on the spec-
ified confidence interval. For example, a confidence interval
of 95 percent will lead to 0 ~ 2.

3.3
Computation of Test Parameters
We now propose an I/O efficient algorithm to calculate
the test parameters, e.g., mean and standard deviation for
the statistics, as shown in Algorithm 1. The computed mean
and standard deviation can then be used to detect the outlier
in the incoming data set.
Given an attribute data set V and the connectivity graph
G, the Test Parameters Computation(TPC) algorithm first
retrieves the neighbor nodes from G for each data object
x. It then computes the difference of the attribute value of
x and the average of the attribute values of x's neighbor
nodes. These different values are then stored as a set in
the AvgDist_Set. Finally, the AvgDist_Set is used to get the
distribution value ps and as. Note that the data objects are
processed on a page basis to reduce redundant I/O.

Test Parameters Computation(TPC) Algorithm

Input: S is the attribute space;
D is the attribute data set in S;
F is the distance function in S;
ND is the depth of neighbor;
G = (D, E) is the spatial graph;

Output:
(/~ ,o'a).
for(i=l;i < IDI 5++){
O~=Get_One_Object(i.D);/* Select each objectfrom D */
NNS=Find_Neighbor_Nodes-Set(O~ ,ND,G);
/* Find neighbornodes of O~from G */
Accum_Dist=0;
for(j=l;j_< INSSl;j++){
Ot~=Get-One.Object(j,NNS);/* Select eachobject */I
Accum_Dist+= F(Oi, 0~, S)
}
Avg_Oist = Accum_Dist / [NNSI;
Add_Element(AvgDist_Set,i);
/* Add the element */
}
/z8 = Get_Mean(AvgDist_Set);
/* Compute Mean */
~rj = Get.Standard_Dev(AvgDist_Set);
return (/~6 ,o', ).

3.4
Computation of Test Results
The neighborhood aggregate statistics value, e.g., mean
and standard deviation, computed in the TPC algorithm
can be used to verify the outliers in an incoming data set.
The two verification procedures are Route Outlier Detec-
tion(ROD) and Random Node Verification(RNV). The ROD
procedure detects the spatial outliers from a user specified
route, as shown in Algorithm 2. The RNV procedure checks
the outliers from a set of randomly generated nodes. Given
route RN in the data set D with graph structure G, the
ROD algorithm first retrieves the neighboring nodes from
G for each data object x in the route RN, then it com-
putes the difference S(x) between the attribute value of x
and the average of attribute values of x's neighboring nodes.
Each S(x) can then be tested using the spatial outlier de-

tection test [ ~ l
> 0. The 0 is predetermined by the
given confidence interval.
The steps to detect outliers in
both ROD and RNV axe similar, except that the RNV has
no shared data access needs across tests for different nodes.
The I/O operations for Find__Neighbor..Nodes.Set0 in dif-
ferent iterations are independent of each other in RNV. We
note that the operation Find_Neighbor--Nodes-Set0 is exe-
cuted once in each iteration and dominates the I/O cost of
the entire algorithm.
The storage of the data set should
support the I/O efficient computation of this operation. We
discuss the choice for storage structure and provide an ex-
perimental comparison in Sections 5 and 6.

Route Outlier Detection(ROD) Algorithm

D is the attribute data set in S;
F is the distance function in S;
ND is the depth of neighbor;
G = (D, E) is the spatial graph;

RN is the set of node in a route;

Output: Outlier_Set.

Oi=Get_One_Object(i,D); /* Select each object from D */
NNS=Find_Neighbet_Nodes.Set(el ,ND,G);
/* Find neighbor nodes of Oi from G */
Accum_Dist=O;
for(j=l;i_< INSSl;j++){
O/a=Get_One_Object(j,NNS); /* Select each object */
Accum_Dist += F( Oi , 0~ , S)

}
}
return Outlier_Set.

Algorithm 2: Pseudo-code for route outlier detection

The I/O cost of ROD and RNV are also dominated by
the I/O cost of Find-Neighbor_Nodes_Set0 operation.

ANALYTICAL EVALUATION
In this section, we provide simple algebraic cost models
for the I/O cost of outlier detection operations, using the
Connectivity Residue Ratio(CRR) measure of physical page
clustering methods. The CRR value is determined by the
page clustering method, the data record size, and the page
size. The CRI~ value is defined as follows.

Table 1: Symbols used in Cost Analysis

Table 1 lists the symbols used to develop our cost formu-
las. c~ is the CRR value. /3 denotes the blocking factor,
which is the number of data records that can be stored in
one memory page. A is the average number of nodes in the
neighbor list of a node. N is the total number of nodes in
the data set, L is the number of nodes along a route, and
R is the number of nodes randomly generated by users for
spatial outlier verification.

4.1
Cost Modeling
The TPC algorithm is a nest loop index join. Suppose
that we use two memory buffers. If one memory buffer stores
the data object x used in the outer loop and the other mem-
ory buffer is reserved for processing the neighbors of x, we
get the following cost function to estimate the number num-
ber of page accesses.
CTPO = ff +N.h.
(1 -a)
The outer loop retrieves all the data records on a page
basis, and has an aggregated cost of ft. For each node x, on
average, a * A neighbors are in the same page as x, and can
be processed without redundant I/O. Additional data page
accesses are needed to retrieve the other (1-a).A neighbors,
and it takes at most (1 - a) * A data page accesses. Thus
the expected total cost for the inner loop is N  A * (1 - a).
In a similar way, a cost model for ROD algorithms can be
derived as follows: CROD = L * (1 - c~) + L * A * (1 - a) =
L * (1 - a) * (1 + A); and a cost model for RNV algorithms
can be derived as follows: CRNv = R + R  A  (1 - a)

5.
EXPERIMENT DESIGN
In this section, we describe the layout of our experiments
and then illustrate the candidate clustering methods.

5.1
Experimental Layout
The design of our experiments is shown in Figure 2. Us-
ing the Twin Cities Highway Connectivity Graph(TCHCG),
we took data from the TCHCG and physically stored the
data set into data pages using different clustering strate-
gies and page sizes. These data pages were then processed
to generate the global distribution or sampling distribution,
depending on the size of the data sets.
We compared different data page clustering schemesi CCAM
[13], Z-ordering [9], and Cell-tree [4]. Other parameters of
interest were the size of the memory buffer, the buffering
strategies, the memory block size(page size), and the num-
ber of neighbors. The measures of our experiments were the
CRR values and I/O cost for each outlier detection proce-
dure.

The experiments were conducted on many graphs.
We
present the results on a representative graph, which is a
spatial network with 990 nodes that represents the traffic
detector stations for a 20-square-mile section of the Twin
Cities area.
This data set is provided by the Minnesota
Dept. of Transportation(MnDot).
We used a common record type for all the clustering meth-
ods. Each record contains a node and its neighbor-list, i.e., a
successor-list and a predecessor-list. We also conducted per-
formance comparisons of the I/O cost for outlier-detection
query processing.

5.2 CandidateClusteringMethods
In this section we describe the candidate clustering meth-
ods used in the experiments.
Connectivity-Clustered Access Method(CCAM)"
CCAM [13] clusters the nodes of the graph via graph parti-
tioning, e.g., Metis. Other graph-partitioning methods can
also be used as the basis of our scheme.
In addition, an
auxiliary secondary index is used to support query opera-
tions. The choice of a secondary index can be tailored to
the application. We used the B + tree with Z-order in our
experiments, since the benchmark graph was embedded in
graphical space. Other access methods such as the R-tree
and Grid File can alternatively be created on top of the data
file, as secondary indices in CCAM to suit the application.
Linear Clustering by Z-order: Z-order [9] utilizes spa-
tial information while imposing a total order on the points.
The Z-order of a coordinate (x,y) is computed by interweav-
ing the bits in the binary representation of the two values.
Alternatively, Hilbert ordering may be used. A conventional
one-dimensional primary index (e.g. B+-tree) can be used
to facilitate the search.
Cell "lYee: A cell tree [4] is a height-balanced tree. Each
cell tree node corresponds, not necessarily to a rectangular
box, but to a convex polyhedron. A cell tree restricts poly-
hedra to partitions of a BSP(Binary Space Partitioning), to
avoid overlaps among sibling polyhedra. Each cell tree node
corresponds to one disk space, and the leaf nodes contain
all the information required to answer a giwn search query.
The cell tree can be viewed as a combination of a BSP-
and R+-tree, or as a BSP-tree mapped on paged secondary
memory.

EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS

In this section, we illustrate the outlier examples detected
in the traffic data set, present the results of our experiments,
and test the effectiveness of the different page clustering
methods. To simplify the comparison, the I/O cost repre-
sents the number of data pages accessed. This represents the
relative performance of the various methods for very large
databases. For smaller databases, the I/O cost associated
with the indices should be measured. Here we present the
evaluation of I/O cost for the TPC algorithm. The eval-
uations of I/O cost for the I~NV and ROD algorithms are
available in the full version paper.

6.1
OutliersDetected
We tested the effectiveness of our algorithm on the Twin
Cities traffic data set and detected numerous outliers, as
described in the following examples.
Figure 3 shows one example of traffic flow outliers. Fig-
ures 3(a) and (b) are the traffic volume maps for 1-35W
North Bound and South Bound, respectively, on 1/21/1997.
The X-axis is a 5-minute time slot for the whole day and the
Y-axis is the label of the stations installed on the highway,
starting from 1 on the north end to 61 on the south end.
The abnormal white line at 2:45pm and the white rectangle
from 8:20am to 10:00am on the X-axis and between stations
29 to 34 on the Y-axis can be easily observed from both (a)
and (b). The white line at 2:45pm is an instance of tempo-
ral outliers, where the white rectangle is a spatial-temporal
outlier. Moreover, station 9 in Figure 3(a) exhibits incon-
sistent traffic flow compared with its neighboring stations,
and was detected as a spatial outlier.

Evaluationof I/O costforTPCalgorithm
In this section, we present the results of our evaluation of
the I/O cost and CRI~ value for alternative clustering meth-
ods while computing the test parameters. The parameters
of interest are buffer size, page size, number of neighbors,
and neighborhood depth.

6.2.1
The effect of page size and CRR value
Figures 4 (a) and (b) show the number of data pages ac-
cessed and the CRR values respectively, for different page
clustering methods as the page sizes change. The buffer size
is fixed at 32 Kbytes. As can be seen, a higher CRR value
implies a lower number of data page accesses, as predicted in
the cost model. CCAM outperforms the other competitors
for all four page sizes, and CELL has better performance
than Z-order clustering.

6.2.2
The effect of neighborhood cardinality
We evaluated the effect of varying the number of neigh-
bors and the depth of neighbors for different page clustering
methods. We fixed the page size at 1K, and the buffer size
at 4K, and used the LRU buffering strategy. Figure 5 shows
the number of page accesses as the number of neighbors for
each node increases from 2 to 10. CCAM has better perfor-
mance than Z-order and CELL. The performance ranking
for each page clustering method remains the same for dif-
ferent numbers of neighbors. Figure 5 shows the number of
page accesses as the neighborhood depth increases from 1 to
5. CCAM has better performance than Z-order and CELL
for all the neighborhood depths.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we focused on detecting outliers in spatial
graph data sets. We proposed the notion of a neighbor out-
lier in graph structured data sets, designed a fast algorithm
to detect outliers, analyzed the statistical foundation un-
derlying our approach, provided the cost models for different
outlier detection procedures, and compared the performance
of our approach using different data clustering approaches.
In addition, we provided experimental results from the ap-
plication of our algorithm on Twin Cities traffic archival to
show its effectiveness and usefulness.
We have evaluated alternative clustering methods for neigh-
bor outlier query processing, including model construction,
random node verification, an/( route outlier detection. Our
experimental results show that the CCAM, which achieves
the highest CRR, provides thexbest overall performance.
