ABSTRACT

This paper describes a logical extension to Microsoft Business
Framework (MBF) called Analytical View (AV). AV consists of
three components: Model Service for design time, Business
Intelligence Entity (BIE) for programming model, and IntellDrill
for runtime navigation between OLTP and OLAP data sources.
AV feature-set fulfills enterprise application requirements for
Analysis and Decision Support, complementing the transactional
feature-set
currently
provided
by
MBF.
Model
Service
automatically transforms an "object oriented model (transactional
view)" to a "multi-dimensional model (analytical view)" without
the
traditional
Extraction/Transformation/Loading
(ETL)
overhead and complexity.
It infers dimensionality from the
object layer where richer metadata is stored, eliminating the
"guesswork" that a traditional data warehousing process requires
when going through physical database schema. BI Entities are
classes code-generated by Model Service. As an intrinsic part of
the framework, BI Entities enable a consistent object oriented
way of programming model with strong types and rich semantics
for OLAP, similar to what MBF object persistence technology
does for OLTP data. More importantly, data contained in BI
Entities have a higher degree of "application awareness," such as
the integrated application level security and customizability.
IntelliDrill links together all the information islands in MBF using
metadata.
Because of the automatic transformation from
transactional view to analytical view enabled by Model Service,
we have the ability to understand natively what kind of drill-
ability an object would have, thus making information navigation
in MBF fully discover-able with built-in ontology.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Entity Persistence (EP), the data access subsystem in MBF [1] is a
"pragmatic object relational" model. It is object relational (O-R)
in that the programmer deals with objects that are mapped to a
relational database. EP provides the transactional view of the
business data stored in the relational database for the OLTP
purpose. The transactional view is implemented in the form of
objects, their relationships, and processes, to carry out the
necessary business logic for an application.

Figure 1 shows a simple object model in a UML [2] class diagram
describing the relationships among business entities Customer,
Order, and Order-line. In this model we describe that an order is
associated with a customer and composed of a collection of order
line items.
These association and composition relationships
highlight the business logic/intent for these three entities in the
application.

Figure 1 Simple Object Model for Business Entities Customer,
Order, and Order-line
We assume that the object model in Figure 1 maps to a
normalized schema in the relational database by using O-R as
depicted in Figure 2.

If one were to build a data mart to analyze the Unit Price,
Quantity, and perhaps a simple calculation of "Total Price =
UnitPrice x Quantity". They would need to implement a set of
Extraction/Transformation/Loading (ETL) steps to materialize a
star/snowflake schema in a data mart database as illustrated in
Figure 3.

Examining the ETL pipelines and processes for this simple data
mart implementation, we would conclude that the business logic
the ETL needs was encapsulated in the object relationships! For

example, in the dimension building process, the database schema
supporting the Order and Order-line entities needs to be
associated together to create the Order dimension with two
aggregation levels on order and order line. This business logic of
the required ETL is already encapsulated as the composition
relationship in the object model.

Figure 3 Process of Building a Data Mart
After studying the current MBF EP concept and design with our
past background in data warehousing and OLAP technologies [3],
We concluded an interesting finding: The business logic
encapsulated in the object model when building an OLTP is being
reconstructed when building an OLAP based reporting & analysis
application.

This finding made us believe that it is possible to automatically
transform the "transactional view" to the "analytical view" of the
same business data.

1.2 Technologies
O-R mapping in MBF describes how each field in a business
entity (e.g., a "customer name" in the customer entity) is
originated from a column in a database table (e.g., the
CustomerName column in the Customers table). Such mapping
information is stored in MBF metadata store.

At the same time, the advances in OLAP technologies [4] offer
two new technologies that we can leverage to revolutionalize how
near real-time business intelligence can be offered out-of-box
from an application framework like MBF. "Data Source View
(DSV)," describing a transformation in the form of queries for the
data obtained from a relational database, can be persisted on the
OLAP server without the need to materialize as views or tables in
a SQL database, which is required by traditional data mart
implementation (e.g., the one in Figure 3). This feature offers a
non-intrusive way of creating a default data mart based on the
OLTP database.
The second advance is the "proactive caching."
Proactive
caching enables changes in an OLTP database to be propagated
quickly to the OLAP aggregates, thus removing the latency
problems faced by a data mart--can take more than 24 hours to
refresh the aggregates.

1.3 Conceptualized Design
To leverage these advances, we built MBF Model Service to
produce the OLAP cubes inferred from MBF object models based
on the mapping information from the metadata store.

Figure 4 shows how a dimensional model is derived from the
sample object model. The dimensionality is inferred based on the
object relationships among business entities after a particular set
of numeric fields are identified as the measures.

this, Model Service generates C# classes to access the generated

The C# classes, called Business Intelligence (BI) Entities,

Entities, we enabled application developers to quickly employ the
functionality of OLAP technologies without having to learn them
in the first place--developers only have to deal with the same
object-oriented programming model as they were to use EP
objects for business entities.

After BI Entities are generated, we also implement an object
model to express the criteria to consume the data. An instance of
the criteria object will be translated into OLAP type of query
language such as Multi-Dimension Expression (MDX) [5].

One of the most important aspects of AV is the process of
automatically inferring the corresponding analytical model from
the transaction business logic. This process not only enables BI
entities to be generated automatically but also preserves the
"transformation" logic to offer the full fidelity of the metadata
describing relationships between business entities and BI Entities.

The end result of this process is a technical break-through that
enables BI Entities to drill back to business entities and navigate
among them. It is common to navigate through an object graph
by traversing object relationships. However, we expanded the
concept in the business framework area by having the ability to
leverage metadata, to drill back and forth between the transaction
and analytical views of business data in their respective object
layers. For example, the default support for drilling back from an
income statement report to the actual transactions is highly
desirable with today's increasing scrutiny on financial reporting.

In order to leverage this rich set of relationships in the metadata
store, we implemented a runtime service, called IntelliDrill.
IntelliDrill furthers the idea used by hypermedia [6] for the object
transversal in an object graph.

The IntelliDrill runtime service augments the drill-ability
provided by OLAP cubes by removing the physical constraints
introduced by individual cubes and difference between OLAP and
OLTP databases.
It allows users to navigate "Business
Information Space" based on a set of pluggable drill-path
providers (e.g., drill across, drill to top N, etc.) as opposed to
being only able to drill down or through based on the dimension
definitions for a cube.

2. Architecture
2.1 Design goals
Model Service (design time), BI Entities (programming model),
and IntelliDrill (run time), our architecture vision on "Analytical
View" are depicted in Figure 6.

Note that there are many benefits of having a second server (in
this case, OLAP/UDM) handling aggregations and complicated
types of report processing.

The design goals of the analytical view are to ensure less
contention on the transactional databases, easier access on
information, and tighter integration with the rest of programming
models in the framework. More importantly we want to unleash
the information and data stored in the application through a set of
framework level programming models so they can be fully
leveraged for the BI, data mining, and information navigation
types of functionality.

2.2 Architecture Benefits
Generating reports often requires heavy loads for aggregations or
other data crunching, which constrain the transactional resources.
Asking OLTP database to do "all" these reports will burden the
transactional databases and impact the overall performance of the
reporting and applications.
In enterprises, running ad-hoc
reporting/querying
against
OLTP
databases
is
especially
prohibitive. The analytical view of the business data leverages
OLAP servers to off load the OLTP server and improves the
performance for running reports.

Figure 6 Our Architecture Vision for Business Information
Delivery
With the built-in AV architecture in MBF, we provide the "break-
through" support for near real-time pervasive BI for these cases
where there was no concern on transactional integrity, by
leveraging the latest technology advances from the OLAP
technologies [4]. In most cases today, it actually takes the
traditional data marts/data warehouses a few days to produce that
very same information in these cases.

BI entities offer a consistent way of authoring a report with OLAP
data and give us better control on the framework level
consistencies (localization, security, metadata, customization,
etc.). Without BI Entities, each application team needs to write a
data access component to access OLAP data to create any
meaningful analytical application. In addition, BI Entities are
generated with forward engineering process so there is no
mapping required; the mapping to the physical table columns is
derived from the O-R maps.

Almost all the industry research reports we found and customers
we talked to indicate that drill-ability of the data and analytical
reporting is critical to their reporting requirements. With the
metadata
preserved
during
the
model
transformation
(transactional to analytical), we bridged the information gap that
previously existed between OLAP and OLTP. IntelliDrill furthers
the information access within and beyond our framework.

Data integration is an important part of information delivery
process for enterprises. In our architecture, we leverage "Data
Source View (DSV)" technology to enable applications built on
top of MBF to integrate with other business applications.

3. Model Service
3.1 Architecture
The MBF Model Service consists of three major components as
depicted in Figure 7.

1.
Model Service Translation Engine translates an annotated
object model described by an XML schema, called Model
Definition Schema (MDS), to a dimensional model described
by a UDM Model Schema.




849
Industry/Government Track Poster

2.
Model Service Deployment Engine deploys the UDM Model
Schema on a UDM Server and generates BIEntity to enable
programmatic access to the deployed model.
3.
Model Service Driver for MBF combines metadata stored in
the MBF Metadata Store with additional user inputs and
directions to assemble an MDS document for the Translation
Engine.

Figure 7 Model Service Architecture
The translation engine infers the dimensional model from the
defined object model and the object-relational mapping. The
translator uses a rules engine to create meaningful dimensions and
hierarchies. The translator first examines the model and
determines the objects that are "reachable" from all of the defined
measures. A reachable object implies that a path exists to that
object through relationships, with appropriate cardinality, from
the measures. This insures that the dimensions that are built can
"slice" the measures.

Sitting at the core of Model Service are the IModel interfaces.
These interfaces serve as an intermediate object model that
describes the input object model in a way that is understood by
the
Model
Service
Translation
Engine.
It
isolates
the
implementation of the Engine from the specifics of the many
different ways by which an object model can be described. The
driver pre-translates the object model, to conform to the IModel
interfaces.

The rules engine, next examines these paths, and based on the
user-configured rules, adjusts the probability for combining
objects, and creating hierarchies. The engine then builds a general
dimensional model with appropriate measures, and dimensions.

The result of the Model Service Translator is a general
multidimensional object model. The driver handles projecting that
model onto the target OLAP technology, such as Microsoft
Analysis Server. The generalizing of the architecture allows
supporting different target models by plugging in different
drivers, while allowing the translation logic to remain
technologically agnostic.


3.2 Example
In this example, we describe how to use the Model Service in
MBF:

1.
A developer using MBF designs an object model in UML as
illustrated in Figure 1.
2.
He creates maps of the entities and the relationships in this
object model to relational database objects.
3.
He invokes the Model Service Driver for MBF through the
MBF Analytics Designer
4.
The Driver builds an IModel object model by combining
user inputs with the metadata from the Metadata Store and
then invokes the Translation Engine.
5.
The Translation Engine first generates a Data Source View
which describes the entities and their relationships, which is
then usable to the dimensional database as data sources.
Object relationships such as associations and compositions
are emulated by foreign key relationships understood by the
UDM model.
6.
The Translation Engine then builds a dimensional model on
top of the Data Source View. A cube known as Sales is built
with two measure groups and a set of dimensions. The
measure groups are originated from the objects that have had
measures decorated. The translation engine examines the
relationships and creates dimensions that are "reachable"
from the fact entities. Hierarchies are constructed in the
dimensions following what has been defined in the object
model. The inferred star schema is shown in Figure 8.
7.
The Deployment Engine deploys the dimensional model on a
specified UDM server and generates the BI Entity code for
programmatic access.

4. BI Entity
4.1 Implementation
BI Entity architecture contains three major components as
depicted in Figure 9:

1.
BI Entity Generator: Code-gens BI entities based on the
underneath OLAP cube structure, and saves some extra
BI metadata at the meantime, e.g. mapping information
between BI entity and cube structure.
2.
BI Criteria subsystem: allows user to define criteria
declaratively based on BI entities (objects) and their
properties.
3.
BI data service: translates BI criteria into MDX
statement, then issue the statement to UDM and return
the results.




850
Industry/Government Track Poster

One scenario is as follow:
1.
Model service invokes BI Entity generator to generate
BI Entities, which reflect the underneath OLAP cube
structure.
2.
BI Entity generator saves those BI metadata into MBF
metadata store through MBF metadata service layer.
3.
MBF report designer retrieves BI metadata, and creates
BI criteria declaratively using those BI entity objects
and their properties.
4.
When Report designer asks Rosetta to render a report,
Rosetta data service extension retrieve corresponding BI
criteria for the report part and pass it to BI service.
5.
BI data service first translates the BI criteria into
corresponding MDX statement, and sends the statement
to UDM to retrieve the results.

4.2 Example and Result
We use the example cube illustrated in Figure 8 to show the
generated code snippet.
BI Entity generator will code-gen the following BI entities:
·
CustomerBI: BI entity for Customer dimension
·
OrderBI: BI entity for Order dimension
·
SalesBI: BI entity (primary), which contains all the
measures and dimensions.
The generated C# code snippet is as follows:
public class SalesBI : BIEntity
{

//fields for all measures
private static Measure unitPrice;
private static Measure quantity;

//reference to all other dimension related BI entities
private static CustomerBI customer;
private static OrderBI order;

//properties
public static Measure UnitPrice {...}
public static Measure Quantity {...}
public static CustomerBI Customer {...}
public static OrderBI Order {...}
...
}

To access data from BI entities, the developer needs to create a set
of criteria using BICriteria class as shown below:

//Scenario 1 using ad-hoc criteria to retrieve dataset without instantiating
BI entity
BICriteria criteria = new BICriteria( typeof(SalesBI));
criteria.Rows.Selections.Add(SalesBI.UnitPrice, SalesBI. Quantity);
criteria.Columns.Selections.Add(SalesBI.Customer.Members);
DataSet dataset = criteria.ExecuteDataSet();

The advantages of using BI entities for the aggregation logic
include:
1.
Better performance: because most of the aggregations
are pre-calculated on the UDM server.
2.
Ease of use: all joins are implied using BI, and there is
no need to specify join list as EP does.
3.
Strongly typed BI Entity enforces compile time check
and largely increases developers' productivities.
4.
High level of prescriptiveness: simpler syntax and less
imperative code
5. IntelliDrill
IntelliDrill contains two major components: the service and
provider layers.
IntelliDrill Service layer: expose the "Get Links" and "Traverse
Links" (as depicted in Figure 10) interfaces. Each link represents
a related data path given the current data context, and has its own
criterion behind.
1.
To get links, the service delegates the request to all
providers that are interested and aggregates the results
before returning them to the client.
2.
To traverse a link, the service delegates the request to
the provider who has created the link.

IntelliDrill Provider layer: it is a pluggable provider architecture
that allows IntelliDrill service to delegate "Get Links" and
"Traverse Links" requests to the appropriate provider.

1.
To get links, each provider looks at the BI metadata
from a different perspective and creates a link for each
related data path what is meaningful for itself given the
current data context. E.g. Drill across provider only
looks for other BI entities which share some
dimensionalities with the current data context. Drill
down provider only looks at the business entities that
are the OLTP counterparts of the given OLAP data.
2.
To traverse a specific link, the provider that has created
the link sends the criterion behind the link to the
corresponding data access service layer (either BI or
EP) to retrieve data.


A canonical scenario is as follows:

1.
A consumer sends the current context to the Intellidrill
service to retrieve all possible links.
2.
The IntelliDrill service finds all relevant providers and
delegates the request.
3.
Each delegated provider creates one link for each
related data path based on the BI metadata.
4.
The IntelliDrill service aggregates the results from all
relevant providers before returns them to the consumer.
5.
The consumer could display all possible links before
traversing a specific link.
6.
The IntelliDrill service delegates the request to the
provider that has created the link.
7.
The provider sends the criterion behind the link to the
corresponding data access service layer (e.g., BI, EP, or
others) to retrieve data.

6. Conclusion
By providing the logical extension "AV" and its subsystems to
MBF, we have unleashed the potential of the business data needed
by enterprise employees to make decisions.
And we will
accomplish our team mission: To enable "Biz Information on
Demand" in biz applications, allowing our customers to fully
realize their business potential.

In this paper, we have presented the notion of AV as the logical
extension to MBF. And to enable AV, we have implemented the
following three main subsystems in MBF:
·
Model Service which infers a dimensional model from
the object-oriented models. With this component, we
will enable an array of break-through scenarios to
exploit the potential of using the aggregated data from
OLAP and detail data from SQL in a single report.
·
BI Entities bring alive the analytical data from OLAP
based aggregation engine to participate in the context of
reporting. And, the object oriented way of consuming
the
multi-dimensional
data
has
preserved
the
consistency of MBF programming model.
·
IntelliDrill utilizes the metadata preserved during the
model transformation process. As a result, any data
point in the biz application now can now navigate to
any related data points.
Traditionally, conversion of the object model into the dimension
model is done manually with a lot of effort to re-construct the
business logic that is lost in the process.
In addition, after the
conversion, data has to be imported from the object model into
the dimension model to get materialized.
This creates a big
overhead for the process of data analysis.

The implementation of an object oriented method to consume
multi-dimensional data is innovative. It creates an opportunity for
application developers to utilize one skill-set, the object oriented
programming language, to master the data access from OLAP
type of data stores. The conversion from a set of object oriented
models to a dimensional model is a new concept in the area of
OLAP. Often times, these two models are not related to each
other because people who deal with them have different
backgrounds. The ability to derive a dimensional model virtually
and create an OLAP cube out of it from a set of object models is a
break-through for the business intelligence implementation.

Our invention minimizes this overhead by automating the
conversion process and removes the need to reconstruct the
business logic; as such, we provide a lowest cost of entry point for
application developers to include business intelligence or data
mining functionality in their applications.
