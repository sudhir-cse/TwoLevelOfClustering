ABSTRACT
It has been claimed that the discovery of association rules is
well-suited for applications of market basket analysis to reveal
regularities in the purchase behaviour of customers. Moreover,
recent work indicates that the discovery of interesting rules can
in fact only be addressed within a microeconomic framework.
This study integrates the discovery of frequent itemsets with a
(microeconomic) model for product selection (PROFSET).
The
model enables the integration of both quantitative and qualitative
(domain knowledge) criteria.
Sales transaction data from a fully-
automated
convenience
store is used to demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of the model against a heuristic
for product
selection based on product-specific profitability.
We show that
with the use of frequent itemsets we are able to identify the
cross-sales potential of product items and use this information for
better
pJOdUCt
selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
impact of product assortment decisions on overall assortment
profitability
can easily be evaluated by means of sensitivity
analysis.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the past, retailers saw their job as one of buying products and
putting them out for sale to the public.
If the products were sold,
more were ordered. If they did not sell, they were disposed of.
Blischok
[7] describes retailing
in this model as a product-
oriented business, where talented merchants could tell by the look
and feel of an item whether or not it was a winner. In order to be
successful, retailing today can no longer be just a product-oriented
business. According to Blischok, it must be a customer-oriented
business and superior customer service comes from superior
knowledge of the customer. It is defined as the understanding of
all customer's purchasing behaviour as revealed through his
or
her
sales transactions, i.e. market basket analysis.

Currently,
the gradual
availability
of cheaper
and better
information technology has in many retail organisations resulted
in an abundance of sales data. Hedberg
[17] mentions the
American supermarket chain `Wal-Mart'
which stores about 20
million sales transactions per day. This explosive growth of data
leads to a situation in which retailers today find it increasingly
difficult to obtain the right information, since traditional methods
of data analysis cannot deal effectively with such huge volumes of
data.
This is where knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)
comes into play.

Today, among the most popular techniques in KDD,
is the
extraction of association rules from large databases. While many
researchers have significantly contributed to the development of
efficient association rule algorithms [l-3, 10, 21, 261, literature
on the use of this technique in concrete real-world applications
remains rather limited [4, 5, 251. Nevertheless, the widespread
acceptance of association rules as a valuable technique to solve
real business problems will
largely depend on the successful
application of this technique on real-world
data.
Moreover, it
has been claimed recently [I 81 that the utility
of extracted
patterns (such as association rules) in decision-making can only
be addressed within
the microeconomic
framework
of the
enterprise.
This means that a pattern in the data is interesting
only to the extent in which it can be used in the decision-making
process of the enterprise to increase utility.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of product assortment
analysis
and introduce
a concrete microeconomic
integer-
programming model for product selection (PROFSET') based on
the use of frequent itemsets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
real-world sales transaction data obtained from a fully-automated
convenience store.

The paper is organised as follows.
Section 2 provides an
overview of association rules.
In section 3, we present the
product selection problem and introduce a product selection
mode1 based on the use of frequent itemsets.
In section 4, we
present the results of the empirical study.
Finally, section 5
summarises our work and presents directions for future research.

2. ASSOCIATION
RULES: AN OVERVIEW
A recent data mining technique for market basket analysis is
association rules introduced by Agrawal et al. [l]. They provided
the following formal description of this technique:

LetZ= (il, i2, .... ik} be a set of literals, called items. Let D be a
set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items
such that T G I.
Associated with each transaction is a unique
identifier, called its TZD. We say that a transaction T contains X,
a set of some items in Z, if X c T. An association rule is an
implication of the form X a Y, where Xc I, Y c I, and X n Y =
0.
The rule X 3
Y holds in the transaction set D with
confidence c if co? of transactions in D that contain X also
contain Y. The rule X 3 Y has support s in the transaction set D
if s% of transactions in D contain X u Y.
Given a set of
transactions D, the problem of mining association rules is to
generate all association rules that have support and confidence
greater than a user-specified minimum
support (minsup) and
minimum confidence (minconn.

Generating
association rules involves
looking
for so-called
frequent itemsets in the data [191. Indeed, the support of the rule
X j
Y equals the frequency of the itemset {X, r>.
Thus by
looking for frequent itemsets, we can determine the support of
each rule.

Definition
1 Frequency of an itemset (adapted from [ 191)

s(X, D) represents the frequency
of itemset X in D, i.e. the
fraction of transactions in D that contain X.

Definition
2 Frequent itemset (adapted from [19])

An itemset X is called frequent in D, if s(X, D) 2 c with o the
minsup.

A typical approach [2] to discover all frequent sets X is to use the
knowledge that all subsets of a frequent set are also frequent.
This insight
simplifies
the discovery
of all frequent
sets
considerably.
Once all frequent
sets are known,
finding
association rules is easy. Namely, for each frequent set X and
each Y E X verify whether the rule X \ { yf 3 Y has sufficiently
high confidence.

To summarise, the technique of association rules produces a set
of rules describing underlying purchase patterns in the data, like
for instance bread 3 cheese [support = 20%; confidence = 75%].
Informally, support of an association rule indicates how frequent
that rule occurs in the data. The higher the support of the rule
the more prevalent the rule is. Confidence is a measure of the
reliability
of an association rule.

3. PROFSET: A PRODUCT
SELECTION
MODEL
3.1 Problem Situation
Determining the ideal product assortment has been (and still is)
the dream of every retailer.
From the marketing literature [24] it
is known that the optimal product assortment should meet two
important criteria.

Firstly, the assortment should be qualitatively
consistent with the
store's image. A store's image distinguishes the retailer from its
competition and is projected through its design, layout, services
and of course its products. Therefore, retailers often distinguish
between basic products and added products. Basic products are
products that should not be deleted from the assortment because
they are the core materialisation
of the retailer's store formula.
For example, for a typical convenience store, customers expect at
least beverages, cigarettes, food and candy products in the
assortment.
Therefore, such products should not be removed,
otherwise the assortment will not meet the basic expectations of
customers who visit the store. In contrast, added products are
chosen by the retailer to confirm the store image even more and
should be selected as to maximise
cross-sales potential with
basic products.
Indeed, retailers are interested in adding items
whose sales will not be made at the expense of currently stocked
items but may help increase the sales of other items (sales
complements) [22].
For the convenience store, examples may
include cigarette lighters, coffee whitener or tea warmers.
This
means that added products should be selected by the model
based on their purchase affinity with basic products.

Secondly, because retailing
organisations
are profit
seeking
companies, the product assortment should be quantitatively
appealing in terms of the profitability
it generates for the retailer
(i.e. the microeconomic
framework).
In section 3.2 this
quantitative element will be further defined.

In contrast to the criteria described above, product assortment
decisions are often taken based on rules of thumb; if products
generate high sales, more of them is ordered, in contrast, when
sales of some products do not meet the expectations, they are
deleted from the assortment. In the past, marketing researchers
have attempted to construct optimisation
models for more
objective product selection [I 6, 27,281 and shelf space allocation
[6, 8, 1l-16, 23, 27, 281. Unfortunately, the estimation of shelf
space
elasticities
(for
instance
obtained
through
expert
interviewing),
estimation of substitution
and complementarity
effects between products and the high cost of conducting
experiments
to measure these parameters
have
rendered
systematic use of these models impossible in practice. According
to [8] the number of parameters
required
for their
shelf
management model is 2n + nz where n is the number of items in
the assortment. Thus, even for a moderately sized assortment the
number of required parameters becomes large very quickly.
Moreover, rapidly changing market situations require parameter
estimates to be updated continually.
While these models, from a
theoretical
point
of view,
have contributed
a lot to the
understanding
of product
assortment
decisions,
the above
limitations urge for a more flexible and easy to carry out method
for product selection.

3.2 Product selection based on frequent sets
According to the problem situation described above, a model
must be constructed that is able to select a hitlist of products, i.e.
a selection of a user-defined number of products from the
assortment which yields the maximum overall profit, taking into
account background knowledge of the retailer.
A simple solution
to this problem, which is often used in practice, is to calculate
the total profit contribution generated per product and then select
those products, in addition to the basic products that have
already been selected by the retailer, that contribute the most to
the overall profitability.
We call this the product-specific
profitability
heuristic.
Although easy to calculate, it does not




255

take cross-selling effects of products into account.
In contrast,
the PROFSET model, introduced in this paper, implicitly
takes
into account cross-selling
effects by using frequent itemsets.
Before
specifying
the
microeconomic
optimization
model
formally, we will first introduce the parameters and components
of the model.

3.2.I Model parameters

4 Mx is the gross margin of frequent itemset X


# transactions
mj=t?lrj
ifX=c

`d X: Mx=
C
mj
with
j=l
mj = 0 otherwise


It is important to understand why X must equal c for mj to be
non-zero.
The reason is that we will use the sum of all M, to
approximate
the total profitability
of the assortment.
Now,
suppose that mj# 0 when Xc
Tj instead ofX=
q with (il, i2} a
frequent itemset and {il, i2, id} a sales transaction.
Clearly,
{il,
i2)
c {il, il. id} but, because (il, i2) is frequent, it is known
[2] that {il}
and (i2) must also be frequent.
Consequently,
(iI> c {il, ir, id} and {i2} c {il, i2, id} and thus the gross margin
generated by sales transaction {il, i2, id} will add to Mfi,,i2), Mli/,
and MJ~JJeven if id is not selected for inclusion in the hitlist.
Thus, if mj # 0 when X c c, then a single sales transaction
increases the Mx parameter of all the frequent itemsets that are
contained in that transaction.
To summarise, a single sales
transaction is allowed to contribute to the total profitability
only
once through the M,Y parameter of the frequent
itemset that
contains the same items as those included in that transaction.


Cost ofproducts:

Also product handling and inventory costs should be included in
the model. Product handling costs refer to costs associated with
the physical handling of goods. Inventory costs include costs of
re-stocking which are a function of replenishment frequency and
the lead-time of the orders. In practice, however, these costs are
often difficult to obtain, especially product handling costs. For
reasons of simplicity,
we assume that a total cost figure ci per
product i can be obtained for all products.

3.2.2 Model components
The PROFSET optimisation problem is operationalized by means
of an integer-programming
model containing
two important
components:


Objective function:

The objective function represents the goal of the optimisation
problem and therefore reflects the microeconomic framework of
the retail decision maker. It is constructed in order to maximise
the overall profitability
of the hitlist.
Frequent itemsets X and
their associated gross margins Mx contribute in a positive sense
to the objective function.
In contrast, individual products i and
their associated cost ci contribute in a negative sense.


Constraints:

(1) Because the final decisions need to be taken on the product
level instead of on the frequent
itemset level, we must
specify which products i are included in each frequent
itemset X.
This
information
can be obtained
from
association rule mining.

(2) Basic products can be specified by forcing the model to
select certain products.

(3) The size of the hitlist is specified by the ItemMax constraint.

where i and X are booleans.


By using frequent itemsets the objective function will give a
lower bound, i.e. the observed amount of profit will be higher
than indicated by the value of the objective function. The reason
is that we consider frequent
itemsets and thus infrequent
itemsets will not add to the total profit amount in the objective
function. This is however justified because it is highly probable
that infrequent
itemsets exist because of random purchase
behaviour.
Consequently, we claim that the objective function
only measures the profit from structural, underlying
purchase
behaviour.

4. EMPIRICAL
STUDY
The empirical study is based on a data set of 27,148 sales
transactions acquired from a fully- automated convenience store
over a period of 5.5 months in 1998. The concept of the fully-
automated convenience (FAC) store is closely related to that of
the vending machine.
However, as opposed to the product
assortment of the typical vending machine, this new retail store
offers a wider variety of products.
Typically,
a selection of
about 200 products is included ranging from the typical product
categories such as beverages, food, candy and cigarettes, to
products like healthcare, petfood, fruit, batteries, film supplies
(camera, roll of film), which are presented to the customer by
means of a 8 mZ window display.
The product assortment of
the store under study consists of 206 different items. However,
the average sales transaction contains only 1.4 different items
because in convenience
stores customers typically
do not
purchase many items during a single shopping visit.
With
regard to the costs of each individual product in the assortment,
detailed information on handling and inventory costs could not
be obtained so these will be considered equal for all products
and therefore these costs are not included in the model.

Basically, the empirical study involves two important phases.
In the first phase, structural purchase behaviour under the form
of frequent itemsets is discovered by using the data mining
technique of association rules (section 4.1).
Then, in the
second phase, the PROFSET method is used to select a hitlist
of products from the assortment (see section 4.2).

4.1 Mining For Association Rules
As the objective function in the PROFSET method requires
frequent itemsets as input, frequent itemsets and association
rules were discovered from the database. An absolute support
of 10 was chosen. This means that no item or set of items will
be considered frequent if it does not appear in at least 10 sales
transactions. As a consequence, we consider all itemsets X as
non-frequent, i.e. describing random purchase behaviour, if the
itemset appears in less than 10 rows in the sales-transaction
database. It could be argued that the choice for this support
parameter is rather subjective.
This is partially true, however,
domain knowledge from the retailer can often indicate what
level of support may be considered as relevant.
Furthermore,
within relatively small intervals, the model will be insensitive
to alterations of the minimum support threshold. The reason is
that when gross margins of products are within a relatively
small range, frequent itemsets with relatively low support will
not be able to influence the objective function.
From the
analysis, 523 frequent itemsets were obtained of size 1 or 2
with absolute support ranging from 10 to 2833. The size of the
frequent itemsets is rather small; this can however be explained
by the small size of the average sales transaction. Although the
model does not use association rules as input, i.e. it uses only
frequent itemsets, the discovery of association rules will be
helpful for interpreting
the output of PROFSET, as will be
explained in the next section.

4.2 Product Selection (PROFSET)
In order to make the comparison between PROFSET and the
product
specific
profitability
heuristic
straightforward,
we
chose
not
to
specify
basic
products
in
the
model.
Consequently, the model will be able to fully exploit cross-
sales potential between items in the assortment without any
restrictions.
Furthermore, any ItemMax value can be selected
to constrain the number of items for inclusion in the hitlist.
Experiments with the PROFSET method indicate that, for this
data set, important results can be identified:

1.
Using PROFSET,
some products with
relatively
low
product-specific profitability
but considerably high cross-
selling effects are selected for the hitlist.

2.
The PROFSET method enables to assess the sensitivity of
product assortment decisions and, as a result, allows to
identify the importance of the impact of such decisions on
the total profitability
of the hitlist.


Observation
1
We demonstrate observation 1 by a concrete example obtained
from the empirical results with both product selection methods.
Consider the products tobacco brand `x' and cigarette paper
brand >`. Table 1 (above) illustrates the total margin2 of each
product and its according position (with regard to the total
margin) within the entire product assortment. Table 1 shows
that from the product-specific point of view, tobacco is the 17'h
most profitable product in the assortment and cigarette paper
ends up 66'h.
So, when the maximum number of products
allowed in the hitlist is less than 66, according to the product-
specific profitability
heuristic,
cigarette paper
will
not be
included (see column 4). In contrast, experiments showed that
for ItemMax equal to 35, the PROFSET method selects both
products for inclusion in the hitlist
(see column 5).
This
indicates that cigarette paper must have considerable cross-
selling
opportunities
with
one or more products that are
included in the hitlist.
In fact, this information can easily be
obtained from examination of the association rules (section 4.1)
as provided on the following page:

These rules demonstrate that whenever
a customer buys
cigarettepaper, he/she also buys tobacco (confidence = 100%)
and that when a customer buys tobacco he will often also buy
cigarette paper with it (confidence 82%).
A more formal
method [9] to assess the dependence between two or more
products is interest.

The nominator s (X =ZJY) measures the observed frequency of
the co-occurrence of the items in the antecedent (X) and the
consequent (Y) of the rule.
The denominator s (X) * s (Y)
measures the expected frequency of the co-occurrence of the
items in the antecedent and the consequent of the rule if both
itemsets were conditionally
independent.
Table 2 illustrates
the three possible outcomes for the interest measure and their
associated economic interpretation for the dependence between
the items in the antecedent and consequent of the rule.

Table 2: Economical interpretation of interest




3 Recall that substitutability
indicates less than the expected
level of mutual support.
With regard to the products tobacco and cigarette paper
interest is equal to 76.7 >> 1 which indicates very strong
complementarity
effects between the two products.
As a
consequence, when treated together, these two products may
represent a high total profit contribution indicating that it may
be advised to select both products for the hitlist
instead of
selecting only tobacco. Indeed, the total profit contribution of
the frequent itemset {tobacco, cigarette paper} equals 8875
BEF, which makes this sales combination
the 10th most
profitable frequent itemset, and therefore PROFSET selected
both products for inclusion in the hitlist.

However, not all product combinations with high cross-selling
potential are necessarily included in the hitlist.
The profit
contribution of the sales combination must be sufficiently high
for the items to be included in the hitlist.
For instance, the
itemset (toothpaste, toothbrush} has an interest of 2468 >> 1
(extremely
high)
and, according
to the association
rules
generated in section 4.1, they are always bought together.
However, the support count of the itemset is equal to I I
(slightly above the minimum absolute support threshold).
As a
consequence, the total profit contribution
of this itemset (415
BEF) is insufficient to influence the product selection process.
Indeed, this again illustrates that the microeconomic framework
of the retailer directly determines the interestingness of the
associations.
Some associations (see example toothpaste and
toothbrush) are very interesting from the statistical point of
view (i.e. strong dependency between both items) but it is the
microeconomic
framework
of the retailer
that ultimately
determines the profitability
and thus the real interestingness of
the association.


Observation
2

Concerning observation 2, the impact on total profitability
caused by product assortment decisions can easily be assessed
by means of sensitivity analysis. When for instance product i is
deleted from the optimal set, and it is replaced by the best
product i' outside the hitlist,
its impact on profitability
can
easily
be observed
through
the shadow prices
of the
optimisation model.




258

Figure 1 (presented above) illustrates the profit impact of the
replacement of each product in the hitlist. While most product
replacements have only minor profit implications (-2 %), some
products (6, 9, 20, 22) represent major profit drivers that
should not be deleted from the hitlist.
This insight can help
retailers to quantitatively
evaluate product assortment changes.
Furthermore, the replacement of items in the PROFSET model
is based on dynamic reselection of products whereas for the
product-specific profitability
heuristic the product that replaces
the exiting product will always be the one with the highest
product-specific margin outside the list. If this entrant happens
to have no or small cross-selling effects with the items inside
the hitlist, selecting a product with a lower product-specific
profitability
but higher cross-selling effects with items inside
the hitlist could be more appropriate.

In fact, experiments revealed that for 43% of the products,
dynamic reselection
of items with
the PROFSET
model
resulted in better overall profit compared to replacement with
the product-specific profit heuristic. Obviously, the more cross-
selling
effects exist in the product assortment, the more
impressive the profit improvement of the dynamic reselection
will be, when compared to the product-specific
profitability
heuristic.

5. CONCLUSIONS
AND FUTURE
RESEARCH
5.1 Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed a microeconomic model for product
selection based on the use of frequent itemsets obtained from
association rule mining.
More specifically, we integrated the
notion of frequent sets with some important microeconomic
parameters that are often used by retailers to support their
product selection decision-making
process into an integer
programming model.
We used sales transaction data from a
fully-automated
convenience store to empirically
validate our
approach against a frequently
used heuristic
for product
selection.
Results indicated that our model is able to identify
cross-selling
effects implicitly
by using frequent itemsets,
instead of having to estimate cross-selling parameters explicitly
(like it is often done in product selection and shelf-space
allocation models).
We also showed that with our model,
sensitivity analysis could easily be carried out, enabling the
retailer
to quantitatively
assess the profitability
impact of
product assortment decisions.
Furthermore,
the retailer's
background knowledge with regard to basic products can easily
be incorporated
in
the model
by means of additional
constraints.

Yet, the retailer should also consider the following limitation.
The presented model is deterministic
in nature.
This means
that the model assumes that when for itemset {X, 0 one of the
items Xor Y is not selected by the model, consequently all sales
related to this itemset will be lost.
This is of course too
simplistic as customers do not always purchase certain product
combinations intentionally.
Therefore, it may well be that a
fraction of the sales related to that itemset may still be
recovered.
5.2 Future Research
Three main topics will be issues for tirther research.

Firstly, we want to assess our model on supermarket sales
transaction data.
It is expected that cross-selling effects are
more
manifestly
present
in
supermarket
data
because
consumers
typically
visit
supermarkets
to
do
one-stop-
shopping.

Secondly, when sales transaction data from multiple stores with
different
product assortments but more or less the same
underlying purchase behaviour can be obtained, it is possible to
use the PROFSET method to construct an ideal composite
product
assortment.
Indeed,
when
certain
product
combinations
demonstrate to be very successful, the best
product combinations obtained from multiple
stores could be
integrated in one ideal product assortment.

Finally,
instead
of including
only
gross margins
from
transactions for which the items contained in that transaction
equally match the items in the frequent set (i.e. X = Tj), an
alternate model would be to split the gross margin among all
frequent itemsets that are contained in the transaction. While
this may not influence the results for the current case study
(since the average transaction
length was only
1.4), the
alternate model may be able to capture a higher percentage of
transactions in sales data with higher transaction length (since
the model will
cover a higher percentage of transactions).
However, the crucial point then is how much of the gross
margin of a transaction should be allocated to each of the
frequent sets that are contained in that transaction.
Especially,
the
the

6.
PI
problem of frequent sets that are overlapping each-other in
same transaction poses significant problems.
