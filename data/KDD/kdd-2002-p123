ABSTRACT

We propose a novel projection based visualization method
for high-dimensional datasets by combining concepts from
MDS, and the geometry of the hyperbolic spaces. Our ap-
proach Hyperbolic Multi-Dimensional Scalin9 (H-MDS) ex-
tends earlier work [7] using hyperbolic spaces for visualiza-
tion of tree structures data ( "hyperbolic tree browser" ).
By borrowing concepts from multi-dimensional scaling we
map proximity data directly into the 2-dimensional hyper-
bolic space (H2). This removes the restriction to "quasi-
hierarchical", graph-based data - limiting previous work.
Since a suitable distance function can convert all kinds of
data to proximity (or distance-based) data this type of data
can be considered the most general.
We used the circular Poincar~ model of the H2 which al-
lows effective human-computer interaction: by moving the
'~ocus" via mouse the user can navigate in the data without
loosing the "context". In H2 the "fish-eye" behavior orig-
inates not simply by a non-linear view transformation but
rather by extraordinary, non-Euclidean properties of the H2.
Especially, the exponential growth of length and area of the
underlying space makes the H2 a prime target for mapping
hierarchical and (now also) high-dimensional data.
We present several high-dimensional mapping examples
including synthetic and real world data and a successful ap-
plication for unstructured text. By analyzing and integrat-
ing multiple film critiques from news:rec.art.movies.reviews
and the internet movie database, each movie becomes placed
within the H2. Here the idea is, that related films share more
words in their reviews than unrelated. Their semantic prox-
imity leads to a closer arrangement.
The result is a kind
of high-level content structured display allowing the user to
explore the "space of movies".

INTRODUCTION

For many tasks of exploratory data analysis visualization
plays an important role. It is a key for efficient integration
of human expertise - not only to include his background
knowledge, intuition and creativity, but also his powerful
pattern recognition and processing capabilities. The design
goals for an optimal user interaction strongly depend on the
given visualization task but they certainly include an easy
and intuitive navigation with strong support for the user's
orientation.
Since most of available data display devices are two-dimen-
sional - paper and screens - the following problem must be
solved: finding a meaningful spatial mapping of data onto
the display area. One limiting factor is the "restricted neigh-
borhood" around a point in a Euclidean 2D surface. Hyper-
bolic spaces open an interesting loophole. The extraordi-
nary property of exponential growth of neighborhood with
increasing radius - around all points - enables one to build
novel displays.
The %yperbolic tree viewer", developed at Xerox Pare [7],
demonstrates the remarkable elegant interactive capabilities
(visit http://www.inxight.com for a Java demo). The hyper-
bolic model appears as a continuously graded, focus+context
mapping to the display.
Very quickly the navigation by
mouse clicks and drags appear natural and intuitive.
It
supports up to 10 times as many nodes as conventional ap-
proached while providing more effective navigation around
the tree-hierarchy.
The question how effective is visualization and navigation
in the hyperbolic space was studied by Pirolli et at. [12]. By
conducting eye-tracker experiments they found that the fo-
cus+context navigation can significantly accelerate the "in-
formation foraging". Risken et al. [14] compared traditional
and hyperbolic browsers and found significant improvement
in task time for this novel display type.
Unfortunately, previous usage of direct hyperbolic visu-
alization was limited to hierarchical, tree-like, or "quasi-
graph" data.
A H2 grid layout of data was recently in-
troduced by one of the authors by generalizing Kohonen's
Self-Organizing Map algorithm (HSOM) to the hyperbolic
space [15]. JSrg Ontrup applied this HSOM successfully to
text categorization and browsing [11].
In this work we go one step further and introduce the
hyperbolic multi-dimensional scaling (H-MDS) for a direct
construction of a distance preserving embedding of high-
dimensional data into the hyperbolic space. The resulting
H-MDS combines a number of attractive features of multi-




123

dimensional scaling and hyperbolic spaces for an interactive
display. Compared to the HSOM it is not based on a discrete
grid and can be used also in situations where only dissimi-
laxity data but not a vector representation is available.
In Sec. 2 and 3 we introduce the hyperbolic space and
the standard multi-dimensional scaling. Sec. 4 explains the
combination of both concepts into H-MDS. Even though the
look and feel of an interactive visualization and navigation
is hardly compressible to paper format, we report several
results and snapshots of first experiments in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6
we apply the H-MDS for spanning a space of unstructured
text documents, i.e., special "averaged" film critiques. This
approach allows to navigate in the space of selected movies.

THE HYPERBOLIC SPACE H2

2300 years ago, the Greek mathematician Euclid founded
his geometry on five axioms. The fifth, the "parallel axiom",
appeared unnecessary to many of his colleagues. And they
tried hard to prove it derivable - without success.
After
almost 2000 years Lobachevsky (1793-1856), Bolyai (1777-
1855), and Gauss (1802-1860) negated the axiom and in-
dependently discovered the non-Euclidean geometry. There
exist only two geometries with constant non-zero curvature.
Through our sight of common spherical surfaces (e.g. earth,
orange) we are familiar with the spherical geometry and
its constant positive curvature.
Its counterpart with con-
stant negative curvature is known as the hyperbolic plane
H2 (with analogous generalizations to higher dimensions)
[2, 18]. Unfortunately, there is no "good" embedding of the
H2 in IRa, which makes it harder to grasp the unusual prop-
erties of the H2.
Local patches resemble the situation at
a saddle point, where the neighborhood grows faster than
in fiat space. Standard textbooks on Riemannian geometry
(see, e.g. [8]) examine the relationship and expose that the
circumference c and area a of a circle of radius r axe given
by

area:
a(r)
=
47rsinha(r/2)
(1)

circumference:
c(r)
=
27rsinh(r).
(2)

This bears two remarkable asymptotic properties, (i) for
small radius r the space "looks fiat" since a(r) ,~ 7rr2 and
c(r) .~ 27rr.
(ii) For larger r both grow exponentially
with the radius. As observed in [7, 6], this trait makes the
hyperbolic space ideal for embedding hierarchical structures.
Fig. 1 illustrates the spatial relations by embedding a small
patch of the H2 in IR3.
To use the visualization potential of the H2 we must solve
two problems: (i) the data must be "accommodated" in the
hyperbolic space (see Sec. 4) and (ii) in order to inspect the
result we need a projection of the H2 onto a suitable display.
For practical and technological reasons this is a "flat surface"
(we will not be able to buy a hyperbolic screen - at least for
the foreseeable future). Fortunately, the projection problem
was solved more than a century ago.

2.1
Projections of the Hyperbolic Space H2
It lays in the nature of a curvated space to resist the per-
fect projection into the flat Euclidean surface. Each attempt
compromises one or more correct representations of length,
area, and angle (form) relations, as is well known from the
spherical geometry (e.g., the Mercator, Lambert, and stere-
ographic projection).
Similarly to the spherical geometry

several mappings were developed, four are especially well
examined: (i) the Minkowski, (ii) the upper-half plane, (iii)
the Klein-Beltrami, and (iv) the Poincard or disk mapping.
See [2] for more details and geometric mapping to convert
in-between (i)-(iv).

2.2
Properties of the Poincar~ Projection

What makes the Poincax~ projection for our purpose the
most suitable?


Display compatibility: The infinite large area of the H2
is mapped entirely into a circle, the Poincax~ disk PD.
This infinity representation fascinated M. Escher and
inspired him to Fig. 2.

Circle rim "= (x~" : All remote points axe close to the rim,
without touching it.

FocusWContext: The focus can be moved to each location
in H2, like a '~fovca". The zooming factor is 0.5 in the
center ~md falls (exponentially) off with distance to the
fovea. Therefore, the context appears very natural. As
more remote things are, the less spatial representation
is assigned in the current display.

Lines become circles: All H2-1ines1 appear as circle arc
segments or (centered) straight lines in PD. There ex-
tensions cross the PD-rim always perpendicular on

1A line is by definition the shortest path between two points

Figure 2: Woodcut by Maurits Escher, named "Cir-
cle Limit III" (1958). After seeing Coxeter's picture
[2] of the ,Polncar6 projection of the H2, the artist
was fascinated by the infinite space covered precisely
in the disk. All the white arcs are lines in H2 which
(should) intersect perpendicular
at the rim (some
are not perfectly drawn).
Note the "fish-eye" ef-
fect, seen at the fishes: all are of equal size in H2 -
but they appear larger in the center.


both ends 2, see Fig. 2.

Conformal mapping: Angles (and therefore form) rela-
tions are preserved in PD, area and length relations
obviously not (in contrast, e.g., to the Klein-Beltrami
model which is length preserving).


Parallel axiom can be demonstrated. While the Euclidean
space accommodates exactly one parallel3 to a line
through a given point (not laying on this line), the
H2 offers infinitely many. In PD a line is an arc who's
ends are perpendicular to the circle rim.
It is easy
to draw many non-crossing circles through any given
isolated point (see again Fig. 2).

Exponential large space: There exist two kinds of "par-
allels": (i) asymptotic parallels, circles which touch at
the rim in the same "ca-point", and (ii) ultra paral-
lels, circle arcs which do not intersect within PD. One
can anticipate, there is much more space in cx~ than
"usual" - sometimes the H2 is also called "more inten-
sive infinite" than the IR2. This extra space is desired
for finding good accommodation for our data.

2.3
All in one Picture:
Usage of Isometric Transformations

2Sometimes straight lines through the center point are re-
ferred to as generalized circle and considered as a circle arc
with infinite radius.
3A parallel is by definition a line which does not intersect.
For changing the focus point in PD we need a translation
operation (which can be associated to a mouse click or drag
event). In general, the transformations which do not change
form and metric in H2 axe, similar to n:~2 the translations,
rotations, and the reflection. How do these operations look
in the Poincar6 PD? Because all H2-1ines remain H2-1ines,
their corresponding PD circle arcs must remain (general-
ized) circle arcs in PD.
The Transformations that respect these properties (also
called "circle auto-morphy" transformations) are here the
MSbius transformations T(z) which can be formulated using
complex numbers z,a,b: Ta,b(Z) = (az + b)/(bz + ~) with
la[2 - [b[2 = 1. By describing the Poincar6 disk PD as the
complex unit circle, the isometric transformations for a point
z E PD can be rewritten in the more comprehensible form:

z'=T(z; c,O)= Oz+c
~.0z + 1'
10[ = 1, [eI < 1.
(3)

Here complex number 0 describes the pure rotation of PD
around the origin 0. The following translation by c maps
the origin to c and -c becomes the new center 0 (if 0 ----1).
The inverse transformation is

T-l(z; c, 0) = T(z; -0c, 0) .
(4)

Two successive transformations in PD are computed faster
by evaluating the concatenated transformation (see also [6]):

T(T(z; c1,01); c2, 02) = T(z, e, 0),
with

02cl + c2
and
0 - 0102 + 01~1c2
C = 02ClC2 @ 1'
02e1~2 + 1

2.4
Data Accommodation in H2: Trees

Now we turn to the question raised earlier: how to ac-
commodate data in the hyperbolic space.
A solution to
this question for the case of acyclic, tree-like graph data
was provided by Larnping and Rao [7, 6]. By using mainly
successive applications of transformation Eq. 3 they devel-
oped (and patented) a method to find a suitable layout for
this data type in H2.
Each tree node receives a certain
open space pie segment, where the node chooses the loca-
tions of its siblings. For all its sibfings i it calls recursively
the layout-routine after applying the MSbius transformation
Eq. 3 in order to center i.
Munzner developed an other graph layout algorithm for
the three-dimensional hyperbolic space [9]. Her "H3Viewer"
[10] allows fast drawing and frame rate interaction and ar-
ranges trees often as flower-like structures.


3.
MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING (MDS)

First we review MDS and the Sammon algorithm.
Multidimensional scaring refers to a class of algorithms for
finding a suitable representation of proximity relations of N
objects by distances between points in a low dimensional
- usually Euclidean - space.
For a detailed analysis on
proximity structures, see Hartigan [4]. In the following we
represent proximity as dissimilarity values between pairs of
objects, mathematically written as dissimilarity ~O E ~t~
between the i and j item. As usual we assume symmetry,
i.e. Jij = 6j~.
Often the raw dissimilarity distribution is
not suitable for the low-dimensional embedding and an ad-
ditional 6-processing step is applied. We model it here as
a monotonic transformation D(.) of dissimilarities Jij into




125

disparities Dij = D(6ii). In See. 6.3 we will discuss a trans-
formation of adjusting a potential dimeusionality mismatch.
The goal of the MDS algorithm is to find the spatial rep-
resentation xi of each objects i in the L-dimensional space,
where the pair distances d~j -_--d(x~,xj) match the dispar-
ities Dij as faithfully as possible Vi#jDij ,~ dij. Here, L is
typically two or three, since again the main purpose of MDS
is visualization and explorative data analysis. The pair dis-
tance is usually measured by the Euclidian distance:

du=llxl-xJll
with
xiE]R L, i,j E {1, 2, ..N}
(5)

3.1
Sammon's Algorithm

One of the most widely known MDS algorithms was intro-
duced by Summon [17] in 1969. He formulates a minimiza-
tion problem of a cost function which sums over the squares
of disparities-distance misfits, here written as

N

EC{xi }) = Z
E
wij (dij - Dij)2.
(6)
i=1 j>i

The Cactors w~j are introduced to weight the disparities in-
dividually and also to normalize the cost function E to be
independent to the absolute scale of the disparities Dij. De-
pending on the given analysis task the factors can be cho-
sen to weight all the disparities equally - the #lobal variant
(wij"(u) =const) - or to emphasize the local structure by re-

ducing the influence of larger disparities (w~))

which we are using in the following. Summon
proposed a
steepestgradient method, in particular,the (diagonal)New-
ton method to iterativelyminimize the remaining cost or
stress E. He ignored the off-diagonalpart of the Hessian
matrix and used a step length reduced by a "magic" factor
r/of 0.3-0.4. Starting from a random {xi} initialization,in
each iterationstep, one object i" is considered, and Eq. 6
minimized with respect to xi.

The algorithm usually needs several epochs (with random
sequence of selectedi*) to converge to an cost-functionmin-
imum. The usual methods to deal with therisk ofconverging
to a localminimum are restartingwith differentinitialcon-
ditionsand selectingthe resultwith the lowest cost function
or stressE. To save CPU time one may want to start with
a good initialconfiguration {xi} for example by using the
firstL principalcomponents found by PCA.

algorithms.
4.
MULTIDIMENSIONAL
SCALING IN H2

The principtd idea is rather straight forward: instead of
using the Euclidean L-dimensional p,L as target space we
apply Sammon's idea in the hyperbolic space PD. I.e. we
replace the distance metric Eq. 5 by the appropriate distance
metric for the Poincard model (see, e.g. [8])

dij = 2 arctanh f Ixl - xjl
X,.IX-x,mjl) ' x,,x+ ePD.
(11)

Several aspects need consideration:

Stay on disk:
Care must be taken to stay within the
circle PD when updating the point i*. Simple restriction of
the update step ~/Ai* in Eq. 9 is not appropriate. Instead
the Mfbius transformation Eq. 3 leads in the right direction
and handles the exponential shrinkage in the vicinity of the
circle rim.
x~.new) = T(X~.°'d); WAi., 1);
(12)


Gradients:
While the gradients ~dij,~/~Xi,q required in
Eq. 10, are rather simple to compute for the Euclidean ease
(= (zl,q - zj,q')/dij), the case becomes complex for Eq. 11

Cost Minimization
without Second Derivatives:
Due
to the complexity of these results we do not compute sec-
ond derivativesand rather improve the cost minimization
step Eq. 10.
We employed the Levenberg-Marquardt ap-
proach and followed the argumentation in [13]by dropping
the higher derivatives. Each point i has an individual and
bounded A-parameter. More detailswill be reported else-
where (in preparation).

Disparity preprocesslng:
Due to the non-linearityof
Eq. 11 the preprocessing function D(.) (seeSec.3.1)has more
influencein H2. Consider, e.g.,linearrescaiingofthe dissim-
ilaritiesDij = ot6ij:in the Euclidean case the visual struc-
ture is not affected- only magnified by a. In contrast in
H2, a scales the amount of curvature felt that is by the
data. In the PD
this has the effectthat the increasing a
shifts all points further outside - but there is also much
more (exponentially more) space. It depends on the given
dataset and its dissimilaritystructure,what is the optimal




126

~. In the experiments reported below, we set a manually.
We use thisextra degree-of-freedom to choose a compromise
between visibilityof the entirestructure and space for navi-
gation in the detail-richouter areas. It iscertainlypossible
to integrate the optimization of a in the overallminimiza-
tion. However, formapping problems with IRa topology,this
would obviously lead to zeroing a, which is not intended.


5.
FIRST EXPERIMENTS

We conducted first experiments and present several real
and synthetic datasets.

5.1
Iris Dataset

Fig. 5(a-d) displays the obligatory "Hello World" exam-
ple of data mining - Fisher's Iris data set. It describes 150
flower samples of three types: ir/s setosa ("A"), iris ver-
sicolour ("x"), and iris virginica ("+"). 6 is here the Eu-
clidean pair distance in the four components sepal length,
sepal width, petal length, and petal width. They demon-
strat~ that MDS performs well in the hyperbolic plane and
visualize the focus + context effect with three navigation snap-
shots.

5.2
Characteristics of
High-Dimensional Distributions

Feature-rich datasets are inherently high-dimeusional. With
growing dimeusionality most of their volume is contained in
a thin, outer shell. This has consequences of the proximi-
ties distribution of those feature-rich, possibly heterogenous
datasets. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we examined M-
dimensional point distributions with (i) M i.i.d. Gauss ran-
dom variables for each component, (ii) uniform distribution
inside the unit sphere, (iii) on its surface, (iv} inside the
Md-hypercube and (v) on its corners.

Figure 4: Histogram of pair distances 6 shown for var-
ious dimensions M (124,750 pairs from 500 Gauss dis-
trlbuted, random points with unit variance; binning
width is 0.1).



Fig. 4 illustrates the first case. With growing M, the dis-
tance distribution 6 shifts to larger distances without sig-
nificant widening. Even though the peak structures differ
for smaller M, the observation holds also for the other cases
(ii-v) and can be generalized to inherently high-dimensional
data, i.e.not laying in a low-dimensional sub-space.
As noted by several other authors [3, 5] the optimal em-
bedding in low-L spaces tends to a circularring structure
with growing M-dimensionality.
Unfortunately, the situa-
tion bears numerous local minimal and the Sammon algo-
rithm often returns sub-optimal results (some availableim-
plementations exhibit numerical problems and return here
bizarre structures,e.g.the sompak-package).
How does the H2 accommodate such a dataset? It turns
out, that circumstances are much better since the cost func-
tion landscape offersmore space to circumvent local min-
ima. Fig.5 shows the two target mappings for IRa and H2
together with theirdisparity--distancescatterplots{Dij,dlj}
(c~ = 0.33). The remaining stresswas 40% higher for the
Euclidean embedding with ERa = 0.40 versus EH2 = 0.285,
which is comprehensible also in the two {&j, Dij } scatter-
plots in Fig.5(c,d).


6.
APPLICATION TO NAVIGATION

IN UNSTRUCTURED TEXT:

THE "SPACE OF MOVIES"

In times of exponential growth of digital information the
semantic navigation in datasets - particularly for the case of
unstructured text documents - is a major challenge. In this
experiment we demonstrate the application of the hyperbolic
MDS to this situation.

6.1
Bag of Words -
Standard Representation for Text Mining

In the domain of the information retrieval and text min-
ing text is very often treated as bag-of-words and represented
as very high-dimensional vector. One may argue that this
ignores completely semantic information word order - amaz-
ingly the results justify this drastic step.
Given a collection of N text documents, first a vocabulary
- a set of words {wi} is determined.
Words in text are
always preprocessed by a suitable word stemming procedure
and filtering out of stop words. The vocabulary is then the
interesting part of all unique word stems, i.e. the most and
the least frequent words are rejected. Each text document t
is represented by a feature vector ft, where the components
ft,i are determined by


ft,~ = TF(t, wi) log ~
.


TF(t, wi) is the term frequency and counts the number of
times the term wt occurred in document t. DF(wi) denoted
the document frequency and counts the number of docu-
ments where the term occurred. This standard weighting
scheme emphasizes rare words as more significant than com-
mon words, for more details see [16]. Proximity (= 1 - 6)
and therewith diesimflarities of two documents is computed
with the cosine metric

"

6ij = 1 -- cos(~, fit ) = 1 - f~, f,j, with fl =


and efficiently implemented by storing the normalized doc-
ument feature vectors p.

6.2 Computing the Movie Representation:

As an example we used a text collection consisting of film
critiques taken from the rec.art.movies.reviews newsgroup
augmented with genre information drawn from the inter-
net movie database (http://www.imdb.org).
The vocabu-
lary with 5084 distinct terms was extracted and the feature
vectors f, computed (for more details consult [11]). Based
on this intermediate review database we selected all movies
of the categories animation and science-fiction which had
more than five recorded reviews. Then, each average movie
feature vector was calculated from the set of its associated
reviews

f,~=~f~,
/={tit
describing movie m}.
(15)
tEA

In contrast to the usage of directly accessible, brief movie
plot description this procedure increases not only the amount
of source information but also increases author indepen-
dence by averaging.
Fig. 6 shows two hyperbolic MDS results of the 132 se-
lected, well reviewed movies. The color markers indicate
the genre of the accommodated movies. Even though this
information was not encoded in the feature vectors, the hy-
perbolic MDS grouped the movies obviously in a semanti-
cally meaningful manner. The "+" marked film belong to
both main genres displayed here - we find them in the mid-
die, close to the separating border.

6.3 Proximity Contrast Enhancement:

Fig. 7 shows the histogram of the obtained 8646 dissimi-
larities for the 132 selected, well reviewed movies. The dis-
tribution resembles a high-dimension random distribution,
but with an "effective" dimeusionality (compare Fig. 4) cer-
tainly lower then the 5084 dimensions of the movie feature
vector f.
Following an idea from [5] we experimented with non-
linear transformation D(.), which shifts effectively the high-
dimensional dissimilarity modes, seen in Fig. 4, to the left.
The mathematical details are reported elsewhere (in prepa-
ration). The first general effect is the reduction of the "ring-
like" structure toward a more uniform movie placement as
seen in the left versus the right graphic in Fig. 6. The main
rationale is the contrast enhancement between documents
or movies: we want to see related movies closer than their
pure review text statistics would justify.
The improvement can be examined in the lower part of
Fig. 6. The lower left group of triangle, indicating the genre
animations, displays stronger cohesion. In conjunction with
the fully labeled snapshots in Figs. 8,9 they can be identified
as Disney World cartoons.
Furthermore two tight groups
appear: the lower left z~ pair represent "Toy Story 1+2",
the x-cluster on the opposite (1 o'clock) can be identified
as four "Alien" films (see Fig. 9).

7.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The snapshots in Figs. 8,9 give a glimpse at the potential
exploratory usage of the introduced H-MDS, the hyperbolic
multi-dimensional scaling technique.
Obvious clusters like the "Star 'l~tek" group, or the prox-
imity of "Bug's Life" and "Antz" strike. Cineastes may want
to mine further examples in the appendix figures.
Note,
that no extra information was imposed. The spatial struc-

Figure 6: Genre separation with and without distance
contrast enhancement.
The movie become well sep-
arated along their major genres:
the red "x"
mark
science-fiction, the black "A" animation, and the green
"-}-" mark films belonging to both genres.
Again, this
genre information was marked in post processing - not
given.
(Top:) Without the distance contrast enhancement a
ring structure is visible; (bottom) turning it on, allows
to better populate the center area and strongly related
films can get now very close in PD. See the A-couple (7
o'clock) and the x-cluster (1 o'clock).

turing was automatically determined, driven by the (dis-
)similarities of word frequencies in secondary, descriptive
texts of totally unrelated authors.
These resultsshow that the H-MDS
approach iswell suited
to support "semantic browsing" in datasets or document
collections. Compared to the HSOM approach with a fixed
grid [11], the H-MDS freely builds a spatial structure and
can therefore display the closeness of objects - as seen, e.g.,
in the tight "Alien" cluster (Fig. 6). Through the proximity
transformation the resulting distribution and the amount of
visible information can be adjusted to the desired situation.
From MDS the H-MDS inherits the limiting scaling be-
havior of N(N
-
1)/2 required clissimilarities for N points.
One the positive side it also allows to process non-vectorial
data, available only as pairwise proximities.
From the embedding in H2 this new approach profits not
only from the extra space for compressing semantic relation-
ships. It also gains the superb visualization and navigation
properties, which were found to yield significant improve-
ment in task time compared to traditional browsing meth-
ods. ,
Future work will address (i) the automatic customization
of the proximity transformation, (ii) the combination of the
H-MDS with the HSOM for visualizing very large datasets.
(iii) When looking at the label intense appendix figures, it
appears obvious that the display can be successfully com-
bined with various search operations and suitable graphical
attribution.
